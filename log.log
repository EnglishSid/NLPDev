good morning good evening good afternoon everyone thanks very much for for joining us today this is another DXE Tech Town Hall really excited today to what to be with you it&#39;s a big day for us we&#39;ve s we became DXE putting together our views of the future we call these our horizon white apron is to to help align our partners and our clients and our employees towards a common view of the future now today&#39;s competed a is it&#39;s one of the key themes that we&#39;re just hearing about over and over again and that&#39;s a operate your business in the Cliver towards a cloud to the common operating model but moreover how do we begin to execute in this hybrid land ask as we move move into that I really like special guests today one is a Eugene O&#39;Callahan a Eugene is our general manager for a cloud of them more clothes platform team Optio and a former HP ES EDS fellow well and together they are helping to lead so many of our clients so as we move in this model what becomes really important is that this is a DXE tech talk for those of you who haven&#39;t been on it and what we re at the very very beginning of the session and then we move on to the second half hour on the crowd chat platform line conversation set across multiple social media outlets and so what you re going to see right is the world Hale and and and then this whole recorded video conversation this hangout is going to be a place to up in YouTube so Heather how about moving us back to the to that second slide for me thank you today our paper series for those of you in our partner community and our in our in our step F achieve digital help value out of digital becoming a digital enterprise a 21st century enterprises you reshape your products your services your strap please but overall driving productivity in both top line and bottom line improvement for the enterprise so we can enterprise the disruptions that are naturally occurring we are furthermore kicking off later this week to get it duncamp papers where we are beginning to promote how to move digital and the evidence of success that we have to the incremental failure that we do have going through this process because after all I think just as important as what to get right along and and what we do instead and so we re going to doing that so let s jump into operating your business in a cloudy as a cloud this we ve been working around the clouds for a long time we ve really been gun to recognize that there s massive business agility that comes from the self-service basis federal environment and many people have for a long time kind of denigrated IT because their pace did not match the pace that the develop wanted with respect to the portfolio and what we do know is that you know public clouds are invading you know we all have private cloud stay at clouds today and we oftentimes need to begin to understand that landscape a little bit better and for me it comes down to a fairly important piece of of insight data has graphics and data has gravity because there s so much of it coming out it is it has allowed to wait just in its volume and its velocity and as businesses have moved more and more to the digital drift devices driven by Internet of Things driven by a partner in ecosystem performance versus in company performance that naturally suggests that data is originating outside of the enterprise more data than originates inside the data of the data center inside the enterprise so we can inclination towards hybrid cloud in which there are private data centers which really process the information and ready to interact with public cloud and then much larger public cloud estates that are interacting with the IOT you fields with the moat even your as a service partners your Salesforce condor workdays your Oracle clouds I m sure I m leaving lots of people out as you re and what that s going to do is produce your network latency reduce your network bandwidth requirements and the execution will continue to be in style and then lastly are probably the emergence of two really critical features for most enterprises the first feature is I if infrastructure-as-a-service as a primary vector of operation certainly that continues to a lateral machine or an instance of the OS by the instance of the OS with you into this new agile environment but more and more we re beginning to see these platforms whatever open shift or cloud foundry or kubernetes or Microsoft container services or even Amazon lambda right we begin to think about think differently applications into small processes which are aggregated through standard api s and this micro services layer we ll talk about later in our application business at a later Town Hall actually just did it at the last town hall so we ll probably be two or three more before we get back to it but this is changing the way that business is operating and even a higher affinity towards hybrid class and then the last one is the governance I do believe that enterprise architects have the opportunity to take back control with the governance platform across their paths and I as capabilities to really begin to maintain control of what I believe to be a much more secure or environment because these rate of style force so with that I m going to transfer over to Eugene to talk a little bit about what DXE II is doing in the hybrid cloud space so thanks Dan you know let s unpack a little bit the business challenges that come with with hybrid cloud you know our clients are really faced with a number of fairly stark business challenges and again a DXE we rally around the CIO as our primary client for the CIO you know there s really two tremendous forces acting and the CIO is right in the middle of that you know on the one hand and the CIO has to deliver secure reliable operations for their existing environment at a lower cost year after year and every CIO has those existing environments with traditional delivery models data center management you know multiple licensing models you know refresh cycles you know mainframe systems distributed system so there s there s a there s a set of complexity and that he or she has to deal with every single year at the same time the business is digitizing for each one of our clients you know for in those industries closest to consumer they re digitizing the fastest the CIO will either enable that digitization for the business or be bypassed so and there s a tremendous set of dynamics associated with that so so really the CIO is right in the middle of that of that dynamic those business challenges lead to a set of IT challenges for the CIO on their team you know how does the CIO focus on a set of business outcomes given all of that complexity how does the CIO rationalize their application portfolio and transform their application portfolio to cloud security an EM you know securing the enterprise a tremendous prerogative for the CIO in the midst of that transform the hybrid journey again if the CIO is both operating an existing environment and enabling a digitization for the business how does the CIO integrate that end end between those two words effectively between a mode 2 and mode 1 world and deliver a secure reliable hybrid IT environment across both again there ll be a huge emphasis take outcasts and to transform from a capex to an optics model and a typical challenge faced that see I also had IT challenges help me empty my datacenter so these are these are some of the business challenges and IT challenges that we see and Jim Miller and ina would like the talk through a little bit of the DXE strategy to address the Jim which I d start exceeding we have a two-prong strategy to address the the business and IT challenges that that Eugene spoke about the first area is transforming with the purpose we want to help our customers transform their IT and business environments by either Rijo sting the architecting retiring some old applications or replacing applications and services with new cloud native approach so that they can quickly to address their business challenges and also lower their overall IT costs while transforming to that new digital environment our goal is to provide a landing zone for the various applications and services depending on the style of workload the the features and functions of that workload so that is run in the place that makes the most sense for it and provides the most flexibility and scalability to meet those business challenges so that IT is no longer holding back the business but enabling it to get to the goals and deliver that value to the end customer IT will become a broker of services those services can be infrastructure as a service software as a service platform as a service or even business process as a service so I keep revised that focal point to enable those various functions be able to select those functions for the business challenge and enable that digital journey and of course our partnerships are key to delivering that journey to digital whether that be AT&amp;T for our networking partner Microsoft and AWS from a platform perspective and a public cloud perspective Oracle and sa p4 software as a service and digital platforms to enable those business processes and no journey is complete without looking at the traditional environment that many of our customers have at the moment our approach to that is to introduce automation to help lower the overall costs of a traditional IT o environment but also improve the service levels and deliver new features and functions even in a traditional environment at a much faster pace so that the business again can adjust react and scale to the various challenges of a digital environment and of course security goes without saying it s a significant challenge in the hybrid environment and that the security processes tools and procedures must span the multiple environments and platforms those range from a traditional IT o environment through a private cloud environment whether that private cloud runs in add exe data center or in a client s own data center all the way through the public cloud environment with many of our customers and running applications and using SAS components in multiple private clouds at the same time in orbit in order to help reduce costs and improve services in the traditional environment IT hygiene is an absolute must so we maintain their operating systems database middleware currency help host those legacy applications and also introduce those IT hygiene functions into the private and public cloud environment so as our customers proceed along their journey to digital the the transition to a cloud native environment and DevOps enabling that environment are absolutely critical so that our customers can introduce new services new functions new applications on a continuous basis and on a very very rapid basis with no interruption to the business so that their customers clients and users see those new functions immediately and they can advance on their digital journey while IT is providing that platform or foundation to enable that piece of the business so our goal is essentially twofold and some earning one is to lower the overall costs of IT services improve the efficiency of those IT services while enabling that path forward to deliver digital solutions to our customers and those digital solutions will come from a hybrid cloud environment that includes private cloud and multiple public cloud environments our intent is to also provide various platforms to our end-users and one of those platforms is s ap are offering for enterprise services on demand for s ap helps customers establish an SI p environment take advantage of flexing that environment the scale up and down to launch new s ap environments for dev and tests and also to launch new S ap environments very very quickly to enable new portions of the business to accommodate acquisitions and flex the business to adjust to the changing business environment and with that I ll turn it back to Eugene for some closing comments on our approach yeah I think it s worth Jim I really appreciate that it s worth just talking a little bit more about our partners you know for example or our managed services for Azure which goes to its second release later this summer you know we re launching that capability and pre integrated with service now for automated client request handling use white range of the Microsoft as your Resource Management templates for full stack automated provisioning as well Microsoft Gomez for analytics and CrowdStrike and others for for security capabilities there so we re focused very much on leaning hard into our key partners Microsoft as an example of course we will be one of the launch partners for managed services for Azure stack as that becomes g8 later in the year as well similar for AWS um you know our managed service for AWS capability comes pre integrated with service now we close formation templates again for full stack automated provisioning with AWS and AWS Systems Manager for automated backup and patch management and system configuration I use these as examples just because it s important you know with our with our delivery model that one we leverage the capabilities and innovation that s there today from our partners until we integrate and IP from DXE into that operational model we operate a cloud ops model with extreme levels of automation for all of our cloud offerings and you know this cloud ops model is available today managed service for AWS and Azure as well as RSA PK papilla T s and with that you know we designed from operations day one that designed for operations from day one in our product owner is working very closely with our operational automation teams race leader for those cloud services as code infrastructure as code and then automate that the whole way through the pipeline automation capability so just a couple of examples on what we re doing with our with our partners Jim and there are others that you care to mention as well yeah I don t go also add our hardware partners are key to our hybrid cloud environment whether that be Hewlett Packard Enterprise deli MC or Lenovo we rely heavily on our partner engineering components to provide a VMware based environment for our hybrid cloud customers that VMware based environment has a foundational component of a hyper-converged or converged hardware environment which helps us deliver faster deliver high quality environments that scale easily to meet the needs of our customers so our hardware particles are very critical to our strategy to work with our customers digital transformation yeah I just want to lean in Anna I I think you re a speed but it also gives us standard right and I really want to lean in on standards so you know what you being talked about with respect to consist with the ServiceNow ITSM layer with the infrastructure as code catalogs that are really the digital recipes that allows it s hybrid environments and deploy workloads against them when we talk about our converged infrastructure or stack providers who are giving us the truck sure every time what we re really doing is allowing automation to play in because you have these go that the the one of the challenges for IT is this is this notion of consistent target and we re getting closer and closer now with VMware moving to consistent operating environments we we know that you know of the passes that are becoming available or giving us a consistent target versus we know that the work that we re doing around even OpenStack is giving us a much more consistent target than it ever did and all of these both a scale and what we call day one which is the ability to consistently instantiate capability quickly and then sistent Li deliver the updates upgrades and improvements in a way that our clients can accept this minimal amount of human error and a maximum amount of continuous innovation the ability to constantly bring new features and functions to a target environment rather than many clouds that end up becoming stranded post day one their current state configuration and so you know certainly one of the things Jim that I know you guys are doing right is is finding ways to continually apply I secure burden BiPAP continually bring larger service catalogs to clients Viki it that really give pace but also ROI anything I want to add to that I think automation is key for us provisioning a virtual machine is relatively easy with today s technology but the automation required to make that virtual machine usable for developers and usable for the end user community is significant we re approaching that very aggressively to harden that VM environment integrated with the operational capabilities and the cloud ops function so that from an Operations perspective we can patch the environment we can run it seamlessly in a hybrid environment provide that level of services and consistency needed to support the business keep them compliant keep them secure and keep them operational whether that be in a controlled environment where the heavy compliance environment we re there to help our customers get there and use automation to do that and I think Jim and Anne know the whole VMware space is a great example of that the way we ve partnered with VM to base the VMware to basically encapsulate all of our automation IP with VMware and separate that from the underlying hardware environment so we run the most automated private cloud environment on the planet most highly secure as well and our ability to do ongoing release management of those automation flows in that private cloud environment is a real differentiator and of course you know we know many of our clients are now looking at as as the next abstraction layer you know so that s an example of where where partnering with Red Hat for you know enterprise-grade container management you know based on industry standard docker and kubernetes there and you know we learn able the further level of abstraction for many of our clients with open shift path services for cloud native application development and deployment there so but all of it for us automated infrastructure as code presented to those clients who want to consume it via via API obviously would have clients also who want to consume via portal and for many of our customers containers and container management is a new concept while it s not new in the industry it s very new for them from an Operations perspective and we are helping our customers along that journey to better take advantage of containers and container management and help them operate it in a seamless environment and also in a secure environment so that they can reap the benefits of using containers from a DevOps perspective to introduce new functionality at a rapid rate to meet the needs of the business alright so let me try to wrap up I continue to have a bandwidth challenges here uh you know what are we the hybrid cloud being a requirement data gravity about being a key driver clouds being move or secure fundamentally begin to compartmentalize in a wave it s hard for traditional IT in the fortress security model that is now no longer relevant in today s day and age of apt we talked about clouds that scale from the biggest baddest enterprise apps with s AP and Oracle another all the way down to micro services with consistency we talked about the manageability with the increased consistency of infrastructure is code in DevOps and and consistent styles and we talked about evergreen innovation that these consistent cloud plants begin to give us at the end of the day I think our clients are looking for probably two things are three things so 1 is an object s business model so we can scale the cost this is they you know two is the agility which is capacity on demand so that they can constantly add virtual machines without waiting and is I really do believe a improved security posture for the enterprise because each developer each project and that container begins to create some isolation around the underlying information like all of those things things begin the drive for a client it s like dxc is doing in the cloud environment with the hybridization should give our clients a lo lot of scale which is to say that one dollar invested with us if we have ten clients on the common platform gives them a much better return on investment of $1 invested if that scale is really important I know we ve had Network challenges today so my apologies but thank you all for staying with us I m going to take Thank You Jean and Jim they ll be with me in crowd Chaput is my chance to you know do it verbally um and and uh [Music] that s all tech talk next week we are I m sorry in two weeks we will be doing the next a crap I ll chat anokhin bed about continuous optimation continue the continuous optimization of enterprise processes the Oh leave that yes is critical but we also believe that unlocking even more of that front-end value comes from a reduced thing against mismatch between the front-end processes and the legacy back-end processes through the massive ability to refactor enterprise processes for speed and machine learning so we re going to talk a lot about that but let s go over to our DXT tech talk right dxd tactile aqua right see you soon

WITH split(tolower('good morning good evening good afternoon everyone thanks very much for for joining us today this is another DXE Tech Town Hall really excited today to what to be with you it&#39;s a big day for us we&#39;ve s we became DXE putting together our views of the future we call these our horizon white apron is to to help align our partners and our clients and our employees towards a common view of the future now today&#39;s competed a is it&#39;s one of the key themes that we&#39;re just hearing about over and over again and that&#39;s a operate your business in the Cliver towards a cloud to the common operating model but moreover how do we begin to execute in this hybrid land ask as we move move into that I really like special guests today one is a Eugene O&#39;Callahan a Eugene is our general manager for a cloud of them more clothes platform team Optio and a former HP ES EDS fellow well and together they are helping to lead so many of our clients so as we move in this model what becomes really important is that this is a DXE tech talk for those of you who haven&#39;t been on it and what we re at the very very beginning of the session and then we move on to the second half hour on the crowd chat platform line conversation set across multiple social media outlets and so what you re going to see right is the world Hale and and and then this whole recorded video conversation this hangout is going to be a place to up in YouTube so Heather how about moving us back to the to that second slide for me thank you today our paper series for those of you in our partner community and our in our in our step F achieve digital help value out of digital becoming a digital enterprise a 21st century enterprises you reshape your products your services your strap please but overall driving productivity in both top line and bottom line improvement for the enterprise so we can enterprise the disruptions that are naturally occurring we are furthermore kicking off later this week to get it duncamp papers where we are beginning to promote how to move digital and the evidence of success that we have to the incremental failure that we do have going through this process because after all I think just as important as what to get right along and and what we do instead and so we re going to doing that so let s jump into operating your business in a cloudy as a cloud this we ve been working around the clouds for a long time we ve really been gun to recognize that there s massive business agility that comes from the self-service basis federal environment and many people have for a long time kind of denigrated IT because their pace did not match the pace that the develop wanted with respect to the portfolio and what we do know is that you know public clouds are invading you know we all have private cloud stay at clouds today and we oftentimes need to begin to understand that landscape a little bit better and for me it comes down to a fairly important piece of of insight data has graphics and data has gravity because there s so much of it coming out it is it has allowed to wait just in its volume and its velocity and as businesses have moved more and more to the digital drift devices driven by Internet of Things driven by a partner in ecosystem performance versus in company performance that naturally suggests that data is originating outside of the enterprise more data than originates inside the data of the data center inside the enterprise so we can inclination towards hybrid cloud in which there are private data centers which really process the information and ready to interact with public cloud and then much larger public cloud estates that are interacting with the IOT you fields with the moat even your as a service partners your Salesforce condor workdays your Oracle clouds I m sure I m leaving lots of people out as you re and what that s going to do is produce your network latency reduce your network bandwidth requirements and the execution will continue to be in style and then lastly are probably the emergence of two really critical features for most enterprises the first feature is I if infrastructure-as-a-service as a primary vector of operation certainly that continues to a lateral machine or an instance of the OS by the instance of the OS with you into this new agile environment but more and more we re beginning to see these platforms whatever open shift or cloud foundry or kubernetes or Microsoft container services or even Amazon lambda right we begin to think about think differently applications into small processes which are aggregated through standard api s and this micro services layer we ll talk about later in our application business at a later Town Hall actually just did it at the last town hall so we ll probably be two or three more before we get back to it but this is changing the way that business is operating and even a higher affinity towards hybrid class and then the last one is the governance I do believe that enterprise architects have the opportunity to take back control with the governance platform across their paths and I as capabilities to really begin to maintain control of what I believe to be a much more secure or environment because these rate of style force so with that I m going to transfer over to Eugene to talk a little bit about what DXE II is doing in the hybrid cloud space so thanks Dan you know let s unpack a little bit the business challenges that come with with hybrid cloud you know our clients are really faced with a number of fairly stark business challenges and again a DXE we rally around the CIO as our primary client for the CIO you know there s really two tremendous forces acting and the CIO is right in the middle of that you know on the one hand and the CIO has to deliver secure reliable operations for their existing environment at a lower cost year after year and every CIO has those existing environments with traditional delivery models data center management you know multiple licensing models you know refresh cycles you know mainframe systems distributed system so there s there s a there s a set of complexity and that he or she has to deal with every single year at the same time the business is digitizing for each one of our clients you know for in those industries closest to consumer they re digitizing the fastest the CIO will either enable that digitization for the business or be bypassed so and there s a tremendous set of dynamics associated with that so so really the CIO is right in the middle of that of that dynamic those business challenges lead to a set of IT challenges for the CIO on their team you know how does the CIO focus on a set of business outcomes given all of that complexity how does the CIO rationalize their application portfolio and transform their application portfolio to cloud security an EM you know securing the enterprise a tremendous prerogative for the CIO in the midst of that transform the hybrid journey again if the CIO is both operating an existing environment and enabling a digitization for the business how does the CIO integrate that end end between those two words effectively between a mode 2 and mode 1 world and deliver a secure reliable hybrid IT environment across both again there ll be a huge emphasis take outcasts and to transform from a capex to an optics model and a typical challenge faced that see I also had IT challenges help me empty my datacenter so these are these are some of the business challenges and IT challenges that we see and Jim Miller and ina would like the talk through a little bit of the DXE strategy to address the Jim which I d start exceeding we have a two-prong strategy to address the the business and IT challenges that that Eugene spoke about the first area is transforming with the purpose we want to help our customers transform their IT and business environments by either Rijo sting the architecting retiring some old applications or replacing applications and services with new cloud native approach so that they can quickly to address their business challenges and also lower their overall IT costs while transforming to that new digital environment our goal is to provide a landing zone for the various applications and services depending on the style of workload the the features and functions of that workload so that is run in the place that makes the most sense for it and provides the most flexibility and scalability to meet those business challenges so that IT is no longer holding back the business but enabling it to get to the goals and deliver that value to the end customer IT will become a broker of services those services can be infrastructure as a service software as a service platform as a service or even business process as a service so I keep revised that focal point to enable those various functions be able to select those functions for the business challenge and enable that digital journey and of course our partnerships are key to delivering that journey to digital whether that be AT&amp;T for our networking partner Microsoft and AWS from a platform perspective and a public cloud perspective Oracle and sa p4 software as a service and digital platforms to enable those business processes and no journey is complete without looking at the traditional environment that many of our customers have at the moment our approach to that is to introduce automation to help lower the overall costs of a traditional IT o environment but also improve the service levels and deliver new features and functions even in a traditional environment at a much faster pace so that the business again can adjust react and scale to the various challenges of a digital environment and of course security goes without saying it s a significant challenge in the hybrid environment and that the security processes tools and procedures must span the multiple environments and platforms those range from a traditional IT o environment through a private cloud environment whether that private cloud runs in add exe data center or in a client s own data center all the way through the public cloud environment with many of our customers and running applications and using SAS components in multiple private clouds at the same time in orbit in order to help reduce costs and improve services in the traditional environment IT hygiene is an absolute must so we maintain their operating systems database middleware currency help host those legacy applications and also introduce those IT hygiene functions into the private and public cloud environment so as our customers proceed along their journey to digital the the transition to a cloud native environment and DevOps enabling that environment are absolutely critical so that our customers can introduce new services new functions new applications on a continuous basis and on a very very rapid basis with no interruption to the business so that their customers clients and users see those new functions immediately and they can advance on their digital journey while IT is providing that platform or foundation to enable that piece of the business so our goal is essentially twofold and some earning one is to lower the overall costs of IT services improve the efficiency of those IT services while enabling that path forward to deliver digital solutions to our customers and those digital solutions will come from a hybrid cloud environment that includes private cloud and multiple public cloud environments our intent is to also provide various platforms to our end-users and one of those platforms is s ap are offering for enterprise services on demand for s ap helps customers establish an SI p environment take advantage of flexing that environment the scale up and down to launch new s ap environments for dev and tests and also to launch new S ap environments very very quickly to enable new portions of the business to accommodate acquisitions and flex the business to adjust to the changing business environment and with that I ll turn it back to Eugene for some closing comments on our approach yeah I think it s worth Jim I really appreciate that it s worth just talking a little bit more about our partners you know for example or our managed services for Azure which goes to its second release later this summer you know we re launching that capability and pre integrated with service now for automated client request handling use white range of the Microsoft as your Resource Management templates for full stack automated provisioning as well Microsoft Gomez for analytics and CrowdStrike and others for for security capabilities there so we re focused very much on leaning hard into our key partners Microsoft as an example of course we will be one of the launch partners for managed services for Azure stack as that becomes g8 later in the year as well similar for AWS um you know our managed service for AWS capability comes pre integrated with service now we close formation templates again for full stack automated provisioning with AWS and AWS Systems Manager for automated backup and patch management and system configuration I use these as examples just because it s important you know with our with our delivery model that one we leverage the capabilities and innovation that s there today from our partners until we integrate and IP from DXE into that operational model we operate a cloud ops model with extreme levels of automation for all of our cloud offerings and you know this cloud ops model is available today managed service for AWS and Azure as well as RSA PK papilla T s and with that you know we designed from operations day one that designed for operations from day one in our product owner is working very closely with our operational automation teams race leader for those cloud services as code infrastructure as code and then automate that the whole way through the pipeline automation capability so just a couple of examples on what we re doing with our with our partners Jim and there are others that you care to mention as well yeah I don t go also add our hardware partners are key to our hybrid cloud environment whether that be Hewlett Packard Enterprise deli MC or Lenovo we rely heavily on our partner engineering components to provide a VMware based environment for our hybrid cloud customers that VMware based environment has a foundational component of a hyper-converged or converged hardware environment which helps us deliver faster deliver high quality environments that scale easily to meet the needs of our customers so our hardware particles are very critical to our strategy to work with our customers digital transformation yeah I just want to lean in Anna I I think you re a speed but it also gives us standard right and I really want to lean in on standards so you know what you being talked about with respect to consist with the ServiceNow ITSM layer with the infrastructure as code catalogs that are really the digital recipes that allows it s hybrid environments and deploy workloads against them when we talk about our converged infrastructure or stack providers who are giving us the truck sure every time what we re really doing is allowing automation to play in because you have these go that the the one of the challenges for IT is this is this notion of consistent target and we re getting closer and closer now with VMware moving to consistent operating environments we we know that you know of the passes that are becoming available or giving us a consistent target versus we know that the work that we re doing around even OpenStack is giving us a much more consistent target than it ever did and all of these both a scale and what we call day one which is the ability to consistently instantiate capability quickly and then sistent Li deliver the updates upgrades and improvements in a way that our clients can accept this minimal amount of human error and a maximum amount of continuous innovation the ability to constantly bring new features and functions to a target environment rather than many clouds that end up becoming stranded post day one their current state configuration and so you know certainly one of the things Jim that I know you guys are doing right is is finding ways to continually apply I secure burden BiPAP continually bring larger service catalogs to clients Viki it that really give pace but also ROI anything I want to add to that I think automation is key for us provisioning a virtual machine is relatively easy with today s technology but the automation required to make that virtual machine usable for developers and usable for the end user community is significant we re approaching that very aggressively to harden that VM environment integrated with the operational capabilities and the cloud ops function so that from an Operations perspective we can patch the environment we can run it seamlessly in a hybrid environment provide that level of services and consistency needed to support the business keep them compliant keep them secure and keep them operational whether that be in a controlled environment where the heavy compliance environment we re there to help our customers get there and use automation to do that and I think Jim and Anne know the whole VMware space is a great example of that the way we ve partnered with VM to base the VMware to basically encapsulate all of our automation IP with VMware and separate that from the underlying hardware environment so we run the most automated private cloud environment on the planet most highly secure as well and our ability to do ongoing release management of those automation flows in that private cloud environment is a real differentiator and of course you know we know many of our clients are now looking at as as the next abstraction layer you know so that s an example of where where partnering with Red Hat for you know enterprise-grade container management you know based on industry standard docker and kubernetes there and you know we learn able the further level of abstraction for many of our clients with open shift path services for cloud native application development and deployment there so but all of it for us automated infrastructure as code presented to those clients who want to consume it via via API obviously would have clients also who want to consume via portal and for many of our customers containers and container management is a new concept while it s not new in the industry it s very new for them from an Operations perspective and we are helping our customers along that journey to better take advantage of containers and container management and help them operate it in a seamless environment and also in a secure environment so that they can reap the benefits of using containers from a DevOps perspective to introduce new functionality at a rapid rate to meet the needs of the business alright so let me try to wrap up I continue to have a bandwidth challenges here uh you know what are we the hybrid cloud being a requirement data gravity about being a key driver clouds being move or secure fundamentally begin to compartmentalize in a wave it s hard for traditional IT in the fortress security model that is now no longer relevant in today s day and age of apt we talked about clouds that scale from the biggest baddest enterprise apps with s AP and Oracle another all the way down to micro services with consistency we talked about the manageability with the increased consistency of infrastructure is code in DevOps and and consistent styles and we talked about evergreen innovation that these consistent cloud plants begin to give us at the end of the day I think our clients are looking for probably two things are three things so 1 is an object s business model so we can scale the cost this is they you know two is the agility which is capacity on demand so that they can constantly add virtual machines without waiting and is I really do believe a improved security posture for the enterprise because each developer each project and that container begins to create some isolation around the underlying information like all of those things things begin the drive for a client it s like dxc is doing in the cloud environment with the hybridization should give our clients a lo lot of scale which is to say that one dollar invested with us if we have ten clients on the common platform gives them a much better return on investment of $1 invested if that scale is really important I know we ve had Network challenges today so my apologies but thank you all for staying with us I m going to take Thank You Jean and Jim they ll be with me in crowd Chaput is my chance to you know do it verbally um and and uh [Music] that s all tech talk next week we are I m sorry in two weeks we will be doing the next a crap I ll chat anokhin bed about continuous optimation continue the continuous optimization of enterprise processes the Oh leave that yes is critical but we also believe that unlocking even more of that front-end value comes from a reduced thing against mismatch between the front-end processes and the legacy back-end processes through the massive ability to refactor enterprise processes for speed and

information including customer data and the location and contents of cargo ships which make them prime targets for hackers and other cybercriminals And since information is the lifeblood of the modern travel and transportation enterprise cybersecurity must be front and center A serious cybersecurity breach can have significant consequences including the erosion of consumer trust Organizations must develop strategies that address both physical and cybersecurity concerns while incorporating the right mix of risk awareness and transparency Travel and transportation organizations should take these steps into consideration: Extend Security Capabilities: Transportation companies need to focus not only on border protection but also on peripheral protection Expanded capabilities mean having a full view of travelers before they arrive at the gate and seeing the full cargo journey while securing each transaction along the way Integrate Security with Route Planning: Companies should integrate security with route planning elements such as risk level assessments travel times scheduling and pricing Also companies should securely track discrete shipments to support enhanced compliance and more accurate management of customs and duty reporting Secure Global Supply Chains: Since many global breaches originate from the suppliers that serve travel and transport firms organizations must ensure the security of the global supply chain This includes tracking the physical movement of cargo and deploying virtual operating centers to integrate and distribute realtime situational data Deploy an Executive Team Approach: A formal data breach response plan — created with the involvement of an executive team — can help organizations monitor and detect threats triage and respond to security events By incorporating “lessons learned ” the plan can leverage proven incidentresponse cycles Security in the travel and transportation sector should be centered on specific proactive steps to

WITH split(tolower('Building a Connected Transportation Platform Security: Toeing the Line Between Physical Security and Cybersecurity Many of us are familiar with the efforts taken by travel and transportation companies to keep people and products physically safe But securing the cyberworld is just as important for this industry Transportation organizations are stewards of sensitive information including customer data and the location and contents of cargo ships which make them prime targets for hackers and other cybercriminals And since information is the lifeblood of the modern travel and transportation enterprise cybersecurity must be front and center A serious cybersecurity breach can have significant consequences including the erosion of consumer trust Organizations must develop strategies that address both physical and cybersecurity concerns while incorporating the right mix of risk awareness and transparency Travel and transportation organizations should take these steps into consideration: Extend Security Capabilities: Transportation companies need to focus not only on border protection but also on peripheral protection Expanded capabilities mean having a full view of travelers before they arrive at the gate and seeing the full cargo journey while securing each transaction along the way Integrate Security with Route Planning: Companies should integrate security with route planning elements such as risk level assessments travel times scheduling and pricing Also companies should securely track discrete shipments to support enhanced compliance and more accurate management of customs and duty reporting Secure Global Supply Chains: Since many global breaches originate from the suppliers that serve travel and transport firms organizations must ensure the security of the global supply chain This includes tracking the physical movement of cargo and deploying virtual operating centers to integrate and distribute realtime situational data Deploy an Executive Team Approach: A formal data breach response plan — created with the involvement of an executive team — can help organizations monitor and detect threats triage and respond to security events By incorporating “lessons learned ” the plan can leverage proven incidentresponse cycles Security in the travel and transportation sector should be centered on specific proactive steps to

platform comprises elements such as enterprise services a partner ecosystem API gateways and infrastructure delivered by scalable hybrid cloud computing and storage The platform should incorporate

"WITH split(tolower('Building a Connected Transportation Platform Security: Toeing the Line Between Physical Security and Cybersecurity Many of us are familiar with the efforts taken by travel and transportation companies to keep people and products physically safe But securing the cyberworld is just as important for this industry Transportation organizations are stewards of sensitive information including customer data and the location and contents of cargo ships which make them prime targets for hackers and other cybercriminals And since information is the lifeblood of the modern travel and transportation enterprise cybersecurity must be front and center A serious cybersecurity breach can have significant consequences including the erosion of consumer trust Organizations must develop strategies that address both physical and cybersecurity concerns while incorporating the right mix of risk awareness and transparency Travel and transportation organizations should take these steps into consideration: Extend Security Capabilities: Transportation companies need to focus not only on border protection but also on peripheral protection Expanded capabilities mean having a full view of travelers before they arrive at the gate and seeing the full cargo journey while securing each transaction along the way Integrate Security with Route Planning: Companies should integrate security with route planning elements such as risk level assessments travel times scheduling and pricing Also companies should securely track discrete shipments to support enhanced compliance and more accurate management of customs and duty reporting Secure Global Supply Chains: Since many global breaches originate from the suppliers that serve travel and transport firms organizations must ensure the security of the global supply chain This includes tracking the physical movement of cargo and deploying virtual operating centers to integrate and distribute realtime situational data Deploy an Executive Team Approach: A formal data breach response plan — created with the involvement of an executive team — can help organizations monitor and detect threats triage and respond to security events By incorporating “lessons learned ” the plan can leverage proven incidentresponse cycles Security in the travel and transportation sector should be centered on specific proactive steps to protect data customers and cargo in both the physical world and the cyberworld It’s a challenge given today’s risks but it’s essential to business success the cloud analytics and applications organizations can harness the potential of mobility and Internet of Things to improve customer service and boost operations Implement a connected transportation platform A connected transportation platform comprises elements such as enterprise services a partner ecosystem API gateways and infrastructure delivered by scalable hybrid cloud computing and storage The platform should incorporate external data sources such as IoT sensors and geolocation data It should also allow third party access via an API portal with software distributed through an app store The various elements of the platform should be connected by ubiquitous software defined secure digital networks The key to success is in integrating information from a variety of data points All modes of transport — be they rail truck air or maritime — should be included In addition as products and services interact the interactions generate data adding value By analyzing the data captured by the platform companies can home in on specific use cases and business problems to solve The better business outcomes that result Building a Connected Transportation Platform Authors Michael S Deittrick is chief technology officer

"WITH split(tolower('Building a Connected Transportation Platform Security Toeing the Line Between Physical Security and Cybersecurity Many of us are familiar with the efforts taken by travel and transportation companies to keep people and products physically safe But securing the cyberworld is just as important for this industry Transportation organizations are stewards of sensitive information including customer data and the location and contents of cargo ships which make them prime targets for hackers and other cybercriminals And since information is the lifeblood of the modern travel and transportation enterprise cybersecurity must be front and center A serious cybersecurity breach can have significant consequences including the erosion of consumer trust Organizations must develop strategies that address both physical and cybersecurity concerns while incorporating the right mix of risk awareness and transparency Travel and transportation organizations should take these steps into consideration Extend Security Capabilities Transportation companies need to focus not only on border protection but also on peripheral protection Expanded capabilities mean having a full view of travelers before they arrive at the gate and seeing the full cargo journey while securing each transaction along the way Integrate Security with Route Planning Companies should integrate security with route planning elements such as risk level assessments travel times scheduling and pricing Also companies should securely track discrete shipments to support enhanced compliance and more accurate management of customs and duty reporting Secure Global Supply Chains Since many global breaches originate from the suppliers that serve travel and transport firms organizations must ensure the security of the global supply chain This includes tracking the physical movement of cargo and deploying virtual operating centers to integrate and distribute realtime situational data Deploy an Executive Team Approach A formal data breach response plan — created with the involvement of an executive team — can help organizations monitor and detect threats triage and respond to security events By incorporating lessons learned the plan can leverage proven incidentresponse cycles Security in the travel and transportation sector should be centered on specific proactive steps to protect data customers and cargo in both the physical world and the cyberworld It s a challenge given today s risks but it s essential to business success the cloud analytics and applications organizations can harness the potential of mobility and Internet of Things to improve customer service and boost operations Implement a connected transportation platform A connected transportation platform comprises elements such as enterprise services a partner ecosystem API gateways and infrastructure delivered by scalable hybrid cloud computing and storage The platform should incorporate external data sources such as IoT sensors and geolocation data It should also allow third party access via an API portal with software distributed through an app store The various elements of the platform should be connected by ubiquitous software defined secure digital networks The key to success is in integrating information from a variety of data points All modes of transport — be they rail truck air or maritime — should be included In addition as products and services interact the interactions generate data adding value By analyzing the data captured by the platform companies can home in on specific use cases and business problems to solve The better business outcomes that result Building a Connected Transportation Platform Authors Michael S Deittrick is chief technology officer for travel and

Organizations that thrive on change use data and analytics as a competitive asset They adapt quickly and predict trends by continually curating and analyzing data and developing insights that drive new value These organizations have a high “analytics IQ ” and they will be the disruptors not the disrupted in the digital revolution Those that successfully harvest vast troves of data can improve productivity make faster and more accurate decisions reduce costs increase competitive advantage and discover new business models and innovations By 2020 30% of Global 1000 CEOs will be strategically planning significant resource shifts from human to intelligent systems cutting across multiple functions and processes Source: IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Intelligent ERP 2017 Predictions Doc #US41870215 November 2016 An exciting new wave of analytics-enabled business innovation is making it possible for organizations to continuously deliver better products and services improve operations better manage risks and develop new business models to stay relevant in an age of disruption To cash in on the promise organizations must incorporate data and analytics into their front-line operations and at points of customer interaction An embedded analytics approach requires a modern hybrid data management architecture and an analytics platform to enable data-driven decision making and the creation of analytics-empowered products and services Surviving and prospering in an age of disruption is the most pressing point of strategy an organization will address in the coming years Those that put analytics at the core of their strategy and operations stand a good chance of benefiting from the accelerated pace of change Becoming the business model IT has long played a critical role in helping organizations deliver better products and services improve operations better manage risks and develop new business models to stay relevant That’s still true Core technologies such as cloud mobility modern applications and networks continue to evolve But IT’s impact on the enterprise is raised to a whole new level when a company introduces advanced analytics Advanced analytics complete the feedback loop between business strategy and IT resources creating a capability that is not only central to the operation of the enterprise it actually becomes the business model For example: •	As an early adopter of advanced analytics the securities industry is now defined by automated algorithm-centric trading and artificial intelligence-based advisors that outperform professional money managers •	Insurance carriers which famously clung to decades-old legacy hardware and software are wholeheartedly embracing analytics-driven systems to target profitable market segments speed claims payments reduce fraud and increase the number and degree of processes than can be fully automated •	Analytics derived from data generated by infrastructure sensors are helping to optimize manufacturing processes throughout the value chain enabling organizations to manufacture smarter faster and greener Advanced analytics are far more than just another name for business intelligence 3 0 The maturation of technologies such as machine learning deep learning artificial intelligence and advanced neural networks coupled with a boundless supply of data and new ways of interacting with systems is creating entirely new capabilities and opportunities Just like the microscope which revealed a world unseen advanced analytics are fast becoming “digital microscopes” that enable organizations to reveal hidden insights and promptly act on them The collection and analysis of huge amounts of diverse data generated by humans machines and enterprise applications are enabling a A Spotlight on Dark Data In an industry where events can go undetected for hundreds of days security professionals have rapidly turned to analytics as a way to shine a light on traditionally hidden data — one that can drastically reduce the risk window and allow organizations to operate more securely Analytics can help mature security operations remain secure — for example by using the latest methods to measure and monitor the behaviour of users and other entities as well as changes in application and device usage over time They can provide high-fidelity alerts to otherwise overutilized security analysts reducing resource costs and ensuring that your best analysts stay focused on the most advanced cyberthreats to your business Big data analytics gives defenders two bites of the cherry While analytics provide a way to detect known attack patterns in a real- time signatureless manner the attackers move fast and alter their techniques constantly Fortunately big data provides the means to marry fresh intelligence on attacks with the latent intelligence stored in data lakes for future use — giving organizations their first sight of compromise A d v e r s a r i

continually changing organization ecosystems that’s not possible by human intelligence and perception alone Advanced analytics are emerging as crucial competitive weapons taking advantage of a wealth of unstructured data and sensor data to provide predictive and prescriptive analytics and business models as well as rules to drive optimal behaviours across complex enterprise ecosystems Astute organizations are now harnessing advanced analytics to pinpoint individual consumer preferences to profitably upsell and cross- sell and to more efficiently develop popular new products and services Advanced analytics are also being used to reduce production and overhead costs and to mitigate risk throughout the product and service consumption life cycles Advanced analytics enable qualitative improvements with each iteration leading to automated and prescriptive solutions This allows organizations to establish continuous testing learning and deployment as the new normal Armed with their

processes in place to enable them to identify and develop new digital business models to better serve their customers and remain competitive Analytics: The LEF Perspective Arguments rage about what is hype and what isn’t the impact of digital technology on gross domestic product whether the effects of mobile devices on society are helpful or damaging and so on; but what seems incontrovertible in research by the Leading Edge Forum is the steady penetration of digital technology in the world Whether it’s the amount of data storage volume of internet traffic number of people with smart devices number of devices per person or proportion of income spent on digital stuff the digital world continues to grow — and grow in importance — apace Figure 1 shows how fast and how far digital activities are increasing and with every physical object potentially becoming both a sensor and controllable there is a real sense that “we ain’t seen nothing yet ” The availability of processing power data analytics and intelligence everywhere in every device and object; the capability to sense and control almost everything in the world — these changes are having deep impacts on business community government sports the arts and more The biggest companies in the world are increasingly asset light An article in a January 2016 edition of “Fortune” magazine noted that Wal-Mart and Amazon were valued at $250 billion each but Wal-Mart employed $154 billion of capital to create that value whereas Amazon increasingly a platform company used only $35 billion New asset-light business models and sources of competitive advantage are shaking up many industries Meanwhile the global geopolitical landscape is shifting most notably the growing role of China in the global economy in terms of both scale and nature Interesting questions are arising about the role of state versus company and blockchain technologies make us question the need for central authority in some areas of our work and lives All of this has an impact on the types of skill and how much of each type that businesses need New digital skills — such as digital anthropology some forms of data science and machine learning — are becoming important but they are scarce There is also an increasingly real issue of software and hardware robots replacing conventional human skills in some blue- and whitecollar roles At the same time as the effects of the digital world on the human tribe are changing with different demographics becoming more accepting of and comfortable with digital channels there are also deeper changes in how we interact with one another and how we use our time mediated by digital capabilities In short almost everything is changing from the very macro to the very micro in the face of digital opportunities and threats In One Minute single day … But there are challenges That all sounds great Many are experimenting And yet many organizations are struggling to see the impact of these analytics projects across the enterprise As analytics begin to create real change organizations are realizing they need to move from ad hoc analytics environments — where data scientists and business analysts experiment and analytics are simply showcased for their potential — to industrial scale analytics that penetrate the organization’s processes to a greater depth and deliver proven strategic and incremental benefits For example in ad hoc analytics environments predictive analytics models are often developed and managed on analysts’ desktops with poor documentation versioning traceability archiving and content management Analytics models are often hardcoded into IT scripts that are not easily extractable for versioning and refresh Putting these models into production often requires rewriting the model from its original source code so it can be embedded into organizational applications with frequent loss of traceability This chasm between ad hoc analytics projects and organizational impact is driven less by the quality of the analytics methods than by the inherent organizational ecosystem cultural resistance to change and suboptimal processes that support integration of analytics insights into enterprise operations and applications It is no longer sufficient to produce robust analytics; analytics need to be operationalized as well Organizations with high analytics IQ understand these challenges and have taken steps to cross this chasm from ad hoc to operational analytics At the same time companies such as Apple Amazon and Google are disrupting established markets by developing new product categories and serving underserved customer segments Think of Apple assembling an autonomous-vehicle organization Tesla moving into power supplies or Amazon moving into the IT cloud business Aggressive asset-light and agile startups with analytics-driven business operations are quickly taking revenue and growth out of traditional organizations To alleviate these existential threats organizational leaders today must not only respond to changing customer demands but must also develop strategies and make investments to develop new business models optimize their processes to stay competitive and ensure that their organizations survive in the age of disruption This is no small feat for long-established organizations burdened by monolithic data and application architectures and systems that have grown organically over many years without an overarching architectural blueprint For these organizations finding and deploying the right analytics and big data technologies are lengthy and complex processes prone to mistakes These processes always trail technology innovations What makes it even harder is that one organization’s architectural blueprint won’t necessarily be the right fit for other organizations even in the same industry or in the public sector Raising analytics IQ is a journey The journey to higher analytics IQ begins by developing a strategy that allows an organization to best leverage the analytics and technology advances known today as well as those yet to come An analytics-powered digital transformation strategy comprises three essential steps: 1) accelerate the digital transformation agenda; 2) build a data-centric foundation; 3) operationalize analytics across the business 1 Accelerate the digital transformation agenda Rapid innovation and productivity breakthroughs require an accelerated digital transformation strategy that melds people business processes advanced analytics artificial intelligence and new human/machine interaction technologies To be successful stakeholders across the entire organization must commit to enhancing analytics insight- driven decision-making capabilities leading cultural changes and applying systematic approaches for optimizing BI and data warehouse environments They should leverage their cost savings to deploy advanced analytics technologies and to operationalize analytics by providing actionable analytics insights to front-line applications and processes Advances in analytics can help not only in achieving productivity breakthroughs but also in identifying cost-saving opportunities value and return on investment from new products and services and value from operationalizing analytics models and automating decision making To take advantage of the power of digital transformation and the innovation it enables organizations need to: •	Create analytics capabilities to deliver new digital business models that can either disrupt the marketplace or defend their organization against disruption •	Craft innovative and intuitive service models and experiences along a customer journey •	Deliver a fundamental operational process transformation that results in meeting or exceeding performance goals Organizations should define their long-term objectives clearly understand where and how new value will be created and design their digital journey maps 2 Build a data-centric foundation The next step is to build a data-centric foundation that can scale with growing organizational needs enable innovation increase agility encompass ecosystem data increase predictability improve forecasting accuracy detect new behavior patterns and deliver information insights in context to processes and applications Companies such as Apple Amazon Google Uber and Airbnb have shown how to build such data-centric foundations and disrupt traditional markets Get to Know Industrial Machine Learning So you’ve earned a spot at the head of your company’s analytics initiative Now what The options for moving ahead can be overwhelming and there are some definite pitfalls to avoid You run the risk of prioritizing the wrong efforts of being led by technology rather than by business goals of being ignored by the enterprise and of spending too much time solving the wrong problem There is a clear path through — a set of best practices for building analytics solutions that will make a difference to your enterprise At DXC we call it Industrial Machine Learning (IML) The term industrial refers to the fact that IML is about moving past small siloed implementations of machine learning into the kinds of deployments capable of putting analytics everywhere in the enterprise Here’s Industrial Machine Learning in a nutshell: 1 Build a data strategy 2 Pick a data story 3 Build an insight utility 4 Run agile experiments Without a strategy you’re subject to the tyranny of action You’re likely to find yourself taking on an analytics initiative simply because that’s what others are doing It may sound reasonable in the beginning but will eventually lead to a series of cookie-cutter projects Start instead with maps of your business priorities and current speeds to insight Use those maps to select your most important data stories Data stories describe the purpose of the analytics initiative in the language of the business rather than the technology With a data story selected you’re ready to build an insight utility It’s just a platform designed to access data ingest and generate insight We call it a utility because we expect it to be a place for the enterprise to plug in a variety of data sources and receive continuous streams of actionable insight With a utility in place you can begin the task of transforming the enterprise But keep in mind that the nature of enterprise-scale analytics is experimental You won’t know ahead of time whether the problem you’ve chosen is truly worth solving Avoid biting off an analytics transformation all at once Instead run small experiments that make it easy for you to recover from mistakes Create a hypothesis about what you think might make a real difference (here’s where having a real data strategy comes in handy) Test those hypotheses using small experiments Learn and adjust as you go The basic practices of IML are where the rubber hits the road if you want to master advanced analytics on an enterprise scale The amount of new data being created is staggering And most industries have only scratched the surface in capturing this new source of business value Now is the time to establish and increase your company’s overall analytics IQ — we’ve even built an assessment designed to help you get started and clean it run automated experiments DXC Technology recommends building a data-centric foundation by adopting the Hybrid Data Management (HDM) approach and reference architecture and implementing the operational analytics platforms based on it: Hybrid Data Management (HDM) Forward-looking organizations take a modern approach to data and organization intelligence — one that enables them to gain data driven insights from new kinds and higher volumes of data — and to transform that information into tangible enterprise results such as optimized operations new business models and data-driven products and services HDM is the foundation of a modern approach to BI and involves optimizing traditional BI and data warehousing blending in big data analytics and embedding prescriptive analytics from both sides into operations and organizational processes HDM provides a strategic direction for instituting industrial-scale analytics integrated into organizational processes and systems that leverage all data and enable organizations to become data-driven and agile Hybrid Data Management Reference Architecture (HDM-RA) An organization must establish the HDM-RA as a foundation for building technical design blueprints for BI and analytics solutions In essence HDM-RA is an end-to-end architecture a selection of recommended technologies and implementation roadmaps for each functional domain and use-case-based design patterns to deliver HDM solutions in as-a-service on-premises and managed deployment models with security and information governance that meets compliance and regulatory requirements Operational Analytics Platform An operational analytics platform is an integrated and complete infrastructure software and services solution based on the HDM-RA It manages data and analytics models and generates business analytics to empower decision makers who need timely information to do their jobs It analyses all organization-relevant data from any source in any format and from any location — with extreme speed security and scale It also gives organizations the flexibility to seamlessly move between cloud and on-premises deployments to meet dynamic requirements While HDM-RA is a logical construct the operational analytics platform is its fit-for purpose physical instantiation based on a design pattern consistent with the specific use-case requirements it supports For example the operational analytics platform can be instantiated to serve one end-to-end organizational process at a time eliminating the organizational technical and process complexities required to serve all organizational units and processes at the same time A predictive maintenance operational analytic platform that serves a manufacturing operations process will differ from the operational analytic platform that serves social media analytics and engagement processes even though both platforms are based on the same HDM-RA 3 Operationalize analytics across your business DXC defines operational analytics as the interoperation of multiple disciplines that support the seamless flow of data from initial analytics discovery to embedding predictive analytics into organizational operations applications and machines The impact of these analytics is then measured monitored and further analyzed to circle back to new analytics discoveries in a continuous improvement loop much like a fully matured industrial process Operational analytics builds on HDM HDM-RA and the operational analytic platform to help organizations implement industrial-strength analytics as a foundation of their digital transformation Organizations that wish to raise their analytics IQ and get a competitive advantage through analytics should follow these core operational analytics process steps: Data discovery begins all analytics journeys and should include the methods technologies and processes to support agile discovery — beyond the traditional ad hoc analytics processes that are common today Analytics production and management focuses on the processes required to support rigorous treatment and ongoing management of analytics models and analytics intellectual property as competitive assets Decision management provides a clear understanding of and access to information needed to make decisions at the right time in the right place and in the right format Application integration incorporates analytic models into organizational applications including customer relationship management (CRM) enterprise resource planning (ERP) marketing automation financial systems and more Information delivery of relevant and timely analytics information to the right users at the right time and in the right format is enabled by self-service analytics and data preparation This improves the ease and speed with which organizations can visualize and uncover insights for better decision making Analytics governance is required This is the set of multidisciplinary structures policies procedures processes and controls for managing information at an enterprise level to support an organization’s regulatory legal risk environmental and operational requirements Analytics culture is key as moving analytics from back-office ad hoc research projects to front-office operations requires a cultural shift Merely having a strong team of data scientists and a great technology platform will not make an impact unless the overall organization also understands the benefits of analytics and embraces the change management required to implement analytically driven decisions Thrive on change Raising an organization’s analytics IQ enables it to thrive on change It allows the organization to use data and analytics as competitive assets to adapt quickly and to predict trends by continually discovering value from data and turning it into insight Ultimately it helps the organization become a disruptor in the digital revolution Considering the impact that using advanced analytics can have on an organization’s most critical goals it doesn’t pay to take a wait-and-see approach to determine whether this is a capability worth having The fact is organizations that raise their analytics IQ are far more likely to successfully manage a chaotic dynamic business environment Those that choose to wait are far more likely to find themselves with a very different fate destined to become the latest members of the ignominious Whatever

Arguments rage about what is hype and what isn’t the impact of digital technology on gross domestic product whether the effects of mobile devices on society are helpful or damaging and so on; but what seems incontrovertible in research by the Leading Edge Forum is the steady penetration of digital technology in the world Whether it’s the amount of data storage volume of internet traffic number of people with smart devices number of devices per person or proportion of income spent on digital stuff the digital world continues to grow — and grow in importance — apace Figure 1 shows how fast and how far digital activities are increasing and with every physical object potentially becoming both a sensor and controllable there is a real sense that “we ain’t seen nothing yet ” The availability of processing power data analytics and intelligence everywhere in every device and object; the capability to sense and control almost everything in the world — these changes are having deep impacts on business community government sports the arts and more The biggest companies in the world are increasingly asset light An article in a January 2016 edition of “Fortune” magazine noted that Wal-Mart and Amazon were valued at $250 billion each but Wal-Mart employed $154 billion of capital to create that value whereas Amazon increasingly a platform company used only $35 billion New asset-light business models and sources of competitive advantage are shaking up many industries Meanwhile the global geopolitical landscape is shifting most notably the growing role of China in the global economy in terms of both scale and nature Interesting questions are arising about the role of state versus company and blockchain technologies make us question the need for central authority in some areas of our work and lives All of this has an impact on the types of skill and how much of each type that businesses need New digital skills — such as digital anthropology some forms of data science and machine learning — are becoming important but they are scarce There is also an increasingly real issue of software and hardware robots replacing conventional human skills in some blue- and whitecollar roles At the same time as the effects of the digital world on the human tribe are changing with different demographics becoming more accepting of and comfortable with digital channels there are also deeper changes in how we interact with one another and how we use our time mediated by digital capabilities In short almost everything is changing from the very macro to the very micro in the face of digital opportunities and threats In One Minute single day … But there are challenges That all sounds great Many are experimenting And yet many organizations are struggling to see the impact of these analytics projects across the enterprise As analytics begin to create real change organizations are realizing they need to move from ad hoc analytics environments — where data scientists and business analysts experiment and analytics are simply showcased for their potential — to industrial scale analytics that penetrate the organization’s processes to a greater depth and deliver proven strategic and incremental benefits For example in ad hoc analytics environments predictive analytics models are often developed and managed on analysts’ desktops with poor documentation versioning traceability archiving and content management Analytics models are often hardcoded into IT scripts that are not easily extractable for versioning and refresh Putting these models into production often requires rewriting the model from its original source code so it can be embedded into organizational applications with frequent loss of traceability This chasm between ad hoc analytics projects and organizational impact is driven less by the quality of the analytics methods than by the inherent organizational ecosystem cultural resistance to change and suboptimal processes that support integration of analytics insights into enterprise operations and applications It is no longer sufficient to produce robust analytics; analytics need to be operationalized as well Organizations with high analytics IQ understand these challenges and have taken steps to cross this chasm from ad hoc to operational analytics At the same time companies such as Apple Amazon and Google are disrupting established markets by developing new product categories and serving underserved customer segments Think of Apple assembling an autonomous-vehicle organization Tesla moving into power supplies or Amazon moving into the IT cloud business Aggressive asset-light and agile startups with analytics-driven business operations are quickly taking revenue and growth out of traditional organizations To alleviate these existential threats organizational leaders today must not only respond to changing customer demands but must also develop strategies and make investments to develop new business models optimize their processes to stay competitive and ensure that their organizations survive in the age of disruption This is no small feat for long-established organizations burdened by monolithic data and application architectures and systems that have grown organically over many years without an overarching architectural blueprint For these organizations finding and deploying the right analytics and big data technologies are lengthy and complex processes prone to mistakes These processes always trail technology innovations What makes it even harder is that one organization’s architectural blueprint won’t necessarily be the right fit for other organizations even in the same industry or in the public sector Raising analytics IQ is a journey The journey to higher analytics IQ begins by developing a strategy that allows an organization to best leverage the analytics and technology advances known today as well as those yet to come An analytics-powered digital transformation strategy comprises three essential steps: 1) accelerate the digital transformation agenda; 2) build a data-centric foundation; 3) operationalize analytics across the business 1 Accelerate the digital transformation agenda Rapid innovation and productivity breakthroughs require an accelerated digital transformation strategy that melds people business processes advanced analytics artificial intelligence and new human/machine interaction technologies To be successful stakeholders across the entire organization must commit to enhancing analytics insight- driven decision-making capabilities leading cultural changes and applying systematic approaches for optimizing BI and data warehouse environments They should leverage their cost savings to deploy advanced analytics technologies and to operationalize analytics by providing actionable analytics insights to front-line applications and processes Advances in analytics can help not only in achieving productivity breakthroughs but also in identifying cost-saving opportunities value and return on investment from new products and services and value from operationalizing analytics models and automating decision making To take advantage of the power of digital transformation and the innovation it enables organizations need to: •	Create analytics capabilities to deliver new digital business models that can either disrupt the marketplace or defend their organization against disruption •	Craft innovative and intuitive service models and experiences along a customer journey •	Deliver a fundamental operational process transformation that results in meeting or exceeding performance goals Organizations should define their long-term objectives clearly understand where and how new value will be created and design their digital journey

example by using the latest methods to measure and monitor the behaviour of users and other entities as well as changes in application and device usage over time They can provide high-fidelity alerts to otherwise overutilized security analysts reducing resource costs and ensuring that your best analysts stay focused on the most advanced cyberthreats to your business Big data analytics gives defenders two bites of the cherry While analytics provide a way to detect known attack patterns in a real- time signatureless manner the attackers move fast and alter their techniques constantly Fortunately big data provides the means to marry fresh intelligence on attacks with the latent intelligence stored in data lakes for future use — giving organizations their first sight of compromise A

Arguments rage about what is hype and what isn’t the impact of digital technology on gross domestic product whether the effects of mobile devices on society are helpful or damaging and so on; but what seems incontrovertible in research by the Leading Edge Forum is the steady penetration of digital technology in the world Whether it’s the amount of data storage volume of internet traffic number of people with smart devices number of devices per person or proportion of income spent on digital stuff the digital world continues to grow — and grow in importance — apace Figure 1 shows how fast and how far digital activities are increasing and with every physical object potentially becoming both a sensor and controllable there is a real sense that “we ain’t seen nothing yet ” The availability of processing power data analytics and intelligence everywhere in every device and object; the capability to sense and control almost everything in the world — these changes are having deep impacts on business community government sports the arts and more The biggest companies in the world are increasingly asset light An article in a January 2016 edition of “Fortune” magazine noted that Wal-Mart and Amazon were valued at $250 billion each but Wal-Mart employed $154 billion of capital to create that value whereas Amazon increasingly a platform company used only $35 billion New asset-light business models and sources of competitive advantage are shaking up many industries Meanwhile the global geopolitical landscape is shifting most notably the growing role of China in the global economy in terms of both scale and nature Interesting questions are arising about the role of state versus company and blockchain technologies make us question the need for central authority in some areas of our work and lives All of this has an impact on the types of skill and how much of each type that businesses need New digital skills — such as digital anthropology some forms of data science and machine learning — are becoming important but they are scarce There is also an increasingly real issue of software and hardware robots replacing conventional human skills in some blue- and whitecollar roles At the same time as the effects of the digital world on the human tribe are changing with different demographics becoming more accepting of and comfortable with digital channels there are also deeper changes in how we interact with one another and how we use our time mediated by digital capabilities In short almost everything is changing from the very macro to the very micro in the face of digital opportunities and threats In One Minute single day … But there are challenges That all sounds great Many are experimenting And yet many organizations are struggling to see the impact of these analytics projects across the enterprise As analytics begin to create real change organizations are realizing they need to move from ad hoc analytics environments — where data scientists and business analysts experiment and analytics are simply showcased for their potential — to industrial scale analytics that penetrate the organization’s processes to a greater depth and deliver proven strategic and incremental benefits For example in ad hoc analytics environments predictive analytics models are often developed and managed on analysts’ desktops with poor documentation versioning traceability archiving and content management Analytics models are often hardcoded into IT scripts that are not easily extractable for versioning and refresh Putting these models into production often requires rewriting the model from its original source code so it can be embedded into organizational applications with frequent loss of traceability This chasm between ad hoc analytics projects and organizational impact is driven less by the quality of the analytics methods than by the inherent organizational ecosystem cultural resistance to change and suboptimal processes that support integration of analytics insights into enterprise operations and applications It is no longer sufficient to produce robust analytics; analytics need to be operationalized as well Organizations with high analytics IQ understand these challenges and have taken steps to cross this chasm from ad hoc to operational analytics At the same time companies such as Apple Amazon and Google are disrupting established markets by developing new product categories and serving underserved customer segments Think of Apple assembling an autonomous-vehicle organization Tesla moving into power supplies or Amazon moving into the IT cloud business Aggressive asset-light and agile startups with analytics-driven business operations are quickly taking revenue and growth out of traditional organizations To alleviate these existential threats organizational leaders today must not only respond to changing customer demands but must also develop strategies and make investments to develop new business models optimize their processes to stay competitive and ensure that their organizations survive in the age of disruption This is no small feat for long-established organizations burdened by monolithic data and application architectures and systems that have grown organically over many years without an overarching architectural blueprint For these organizations finding and deploying the right analytics and big data technologies are lengthy and complex processes prone to mistakes These processes always trail technology innovations What makes it even harder is that one organization’s architectural blueprint won’t necessarily be the right fit for other organizations even in the same industry or in the public sector Raising analytics IQ is a journey The journey to higher analytics IQ begins by developing a strategy that allows an organization to best leverage the analytics and technology advances known today as well as those yet to come An analytics-powered digital transformation strategy comprises three essential steps: 1) accelerate the digital transformation agenda; 2) build a data-centric foundation; 3) operationalize analytics across the business 1 Accelerate the digital transformation agenda Rapid innovation and productivity breakthroughs require an accelerated digital transformation strategy that melds people business processes advanced analytics artificial intelligence and new human/machine interaction technologies To be successful stakeholders across the entire organization must commit to enhancing analytics insight- driven decision-making capabilities leading cultural changes and applying systematic approaches for optimizing BI and data warehouse environments They should leverage their cost savings to deploy advanced analytics technologies and to operationalize analytics by providing actionable analytics insights to front-line applications and processes Advances in analytics can help not only in achieving productivity breakthroughs but also in identifying cost-saving opportunities value and return on investment from new products and services and value from operationalizing analytics models and automating decision making To take advantage of the power of digital transformation and the innovation it enables organizations need to: •	Create analytics capabilities to deliver new digital business models that can either disrupt the marketplace or defend their organization against disruption •	Craft innovative and intuitive service models and experiences along a customer journey •	Deliver a fundamental operational process transformation that results in meeting or exceeding performance goals Organizations should define their long-term objectives clearly understand where and how new value will be created and design their digital journey maps 2 Build a data-centric foundation The next step is to build a data-centric foundation that can scale with growing organizational needs enable innovation increase agility encompass ecosystem data increase predictability improve forecasting accuracy detect new behavior patterns and deliver information insights in context to processes and applications Companies such as Apple Amazon Google Uber and Airbnb have shown how to build such data-centric foundations and disrupt traditional markets Get to Know Industrial Machine Learning So you’ve earned a spot at the head of your company’s analytics initiative Now what The options for moving ahead can be overwhelming and there are some definite pitfalls to avoid You run the risk of prioritizing the wrong efforts of being led by technology rather than by business goals of being ignored by the enterprise and of spending too much time solving the wrong problem There is a clear path through — a set of best practices for building analytics solutions that will make a difference to your enterprise At DXC we call it Industrial Machine Learning (IML) The term industrial refers to the fact that IML is about moving past small siloed implementations of machine learning into the kinds of deployments capable of putting analytics everywhere in the enterprise Here’s Industrial Machine Learning in a nutshell: 1 Build a data strategy 2 Pick a data story 3 Build an insight utility 4 Run agile experiments Without a strategy you’re subject to the tyranny of action You’re likely to find yourself taking on an analytics initiative simply because that’s what others are doing It may sound reasonable in the beginning but will eventually lead to a series of cookie-cutter projects Start instead with maps of your business priorities and current speeds to insight Use those maps to select your most important data stories Data stories describe the purpose of the analytics initiative in the language of the business rather than the technology With a data story selected you’re ready to build an insight utility It’s just a platform designed to access data ingest and generate insight We call it a utility because we expect it to be a place for the enterprise to plug in a variety of data sources and receive continuous streams of actionable insight With a utility in place you can begin the task of transforming the enterprise But keep in mind that the nature of enterprise-scale analytics is experimental You won’t know ahead of time whether the problem you’ve chosen is truly worth solving Avoid biting off an analytics transformation all at once Instead run small experiments that make it easy for you to recover from mistakes Create a hypothesis about what you think might make a real difference (here’s where having a real data strategy comes in handy) Test those hypotheses using small experiments Learn and adjust as you go The basic practices of IML are where the rubber hits the road if you want to master advanced analytics on an enterprise scale The amount of new data being created is staggering And most industries have only scratched the surface in capturing this new source of business value Now is the time to establish and increase your company’s overall analytics IQ — we’ve even built an assessment designed to help you get started and clean it run automated experiments DXC Technology recommends building a data-centric foundation by adopting the Hybrid Data Management (HDM) approach and reference architecture and implementing the operational analytics platforms based on it: Hybrid Data Management (HDM) Forward-looking organizations take a modern approach to data and organization intelligence — one that enables them to gain data driven insights from new kinds and higher volumes of data — and to transform that information into tangible enterprise results such as optimized operations new business models and data-driven products and services HDM is the foundation of a modern approach to BI and involves optimizing traditional BI and data warehousing blending in big data analytics and embedding prescriptive analytics from both sides into operations and organizational processes HDM provides a strategic direction for instituting industrial-scale analytics integrated into organizational processes and systems that leverage all data and enable organizations to become data-driven and agile Hybrid Data Management Reference Architecture (HDM-RA) An organization must establish the HDM-RA as a foundation for building technical design blueprints for BI and analytics solutions In essence HDM-RA is an end-to-end architecture a selection of recommended technologies and implementation roadmaps for each functional domain and use-case-based design patterns to deliver HDM solutions in as-a-service on-premises and managed deployment models with security and information governance that meets compliance and regulatory requirements Operational Analytics Platform An operational analytics platform is an integrated and complete infrastructure software and services solution based on the HDM-RA It manages data and analytics models and generates business analytics to empower decision makers who need timely information to do their jobs It analyses all organization-relevant data from any source in any format and from any location — with extreme speed security and scale It also gives organizations the flexibility to seamlessly move between cloud and on-premises deployments to meet dynamic requirements While HDM-RA is a logical construct the operational analytics platform is its fit-for purpose physical instantiation based on a design pattern consistent with the specific use-case requirements it supports For example the operational analytics platform can be instantiated to serve one end-to-end organizational process at a time eliminating the organizational technical and process complexities required to serve all organizational units and processes at the same time A predictive maintenance operational analytic platform that serves a manufacturing operations process will differ from the operational analytic platform that serves social media analytics and engagement processes even though both platforms are based on the same HDM-RA 3 Operationalize analytics across your business DXC defines operational analytics as the interoperation of multiple disciplines that support the seamless flow of data from initial analytics discovery to embedding predictive analytics into organizational operations applications and machines The impact of these analytics is then measured monitored and further analyzed to circle back to new analytics discoveries in a continuous improvement loop much like a fully matured industrial process Operational analytics builds on HDM HDM-RA and the operational analytic platform to help organizations implement industrial-strength analytics as a foundation of their digital transformation Organizations that wish to raise their analytics IQ and get a competitive advantage through analytics should follow these core operational analytics process steps: Data discovery begins all analytics journeys and should include the methods technologies and processes to support agile discovery — beyond the traditional ad hoc analytics processes that are common today Analytics production and management focuses on the processes required to support rigorous treatment and ongoing management of analytics models and analytics intellectual property as competitive assets Decision management provides a clear understanding of and access to information needed to make decisions at the right time in the right place and in the right format Application integration incorporates analytic models into organizational applications including customer relationship management (CRM) enterprise resource planning (ERP) marketing automation financial systems and more Information delivery of relevant and timely analytics information to the right users at the right time and in the right format is enabled by self-service analytics and data preparation This improves the ease and speed with which organizations can visualize and uncover insights for better decision making Analytics governance is required This is the set of multidisciplinary structures policies procedures processes and controls for managing information at an enterprise level to support an organization’s regulatory legal risk environmental and operational requirements Analytics culture is key as moving analytics from back-office ad hoc research projects to front-office operations requires a cultural shift Merely having a strong team of data scientists and a great technology platform will not make an impact unless the overall organization also understands the benefits of analytics and embraces the change management required to implement analytically driven decisions Thrive on change Raising an organization’s analytics IQ enables it to thrive on change It allows the organization to use data and analytics as competitive assets to adapt quickly and to predict trends by continually discovering value from data and turning it into insight Ultimately it helps the organization become a disruptor in the digital revolution Considering the impact that using advanced analytics can have on an organization’s most critical goals it doesn’t pay to take a wait-and-see approach to determine whether this is a capability worth having The fact is organizations that raise their analytics IQ are far more likely to successfully manage a chaotic dynamic business environment Those that choose to wait are far more likely to find themselves with a very different fate destined to become the latest members of the ignominious Whatever

? Software can be disruptive and enterprises must take steps to deal with the pressures caused by the emergence of nimble upstart companies Software based competition is overturning entire industries and forcing companies to change how they think about their own value The biggest changes will come not from the software applications themselves but instead from the modern application platform and the dynamic integration of the components that power it This includes APIs automation virtualization and microservices Enterprises must also meet the challenge of delivering seamless digital experiences to satisfy rapidly changing consumer driven expectations The central focus needs to be on delivering business outcomes A modern application platform based on business measures rather than technology measures can empower organizations to create new customer friendly services unlock data from older applications and build the foundation of a digital core that will transform the business and deliver measurable results Emerging companies that have formulated an approach that’s based in software and the internet as a way of driving business are causing massive disruptions in the traditional ways of doing things These players can be considered “asymmetrical competition” to established businesses that were once dominant but are now finding themselves having to compete in ways they did not consider before While the asymmetrical competition is unencumbered by technology debt and has no existing capital commitments a significant problem exists for the established organizations They must contend with very large installations of IT that they built at great expense to get to where they are today And above all their IT departments need to find ways to help deliver business outcomes rather than focus on solving technology problems People have become accustomed to smartphones mobile applications and ubiquitous connectivity and are taking these consumer experiences into the workplace demanding a better user experience in their daily interactions If a bank for example does not provide the services and capabilities a customer wants that person will simply switch to a different bank This leaves a group of established players wanting to remain competitive and relevant yet struggling to do things their customers are asking them to do Established enterprises are also burdened by legacy assets that are often technology debt — large investments made on expensive endeavors such as hardware and software for a large data center or a massive ERP implementation Still as companies embrace the cloud these physical assets are disappearing and a stronger emphasis is being placed on the importance of application services and building a modern application platform to provide increased speed flexibility and a stronger alignment with the business IT is clearly challenged by the need to rejuvenate itself to become a business partner and focus on things like value rather than being relegated to a cost line item With the shift to cloud serving as the inflection point the operating model is naturally shifting from infrastructure to everything as a service with a focus on applications and business outcomes Thus enterprises are being challenged to undertake a new generation of digital initiatives that includes the creation of agile applications that provide rich digital experiences Companies must focus on a business wide transformation not just an IT transformation They can do this by deploying modernized enterprise and cloud applications that drive shifts in reach insight and the ability to respond to the increased market pressures that threaten to drive them out of business Disrupting the Industry Disrupting the Adversary If agile apps are a critical component of disrupting the industry then the cybersecurity embedded in those apps is critical to disrupting the adversary For large successful companies digital transformation is really about turning a disadvantage into a disruptor Freeing up business know how (“rules”) and transactional data patterns (“insight”) in agile apps — containing “just in time” analytics — can enable better faster cheaper decision making that is at the heart of competitive advantage Those decisions can then result in adaptive (more effective) operations expansive business models and partnerships and personalized communications for customer intimacy This kind of digital transformation requires risk management with cyberrisk being the greatest risk factor to the business DevOps has led to DevSecOps which has two benefits: building security into the agile DevOps construct and using agile DevOps to build security apps This make sense since orchestration and automation can lead to better built in security for all apps Whereas old school systems development life cycles too often relied on “testing flaws out” of the app rather than “building security in” — from concept to requirements to architecture and through design coding testing configuration and deployment — DevSecOps reduces the opportunity to skip steps or just bolt security on at the end That means inclusion of security tooling constant code scanning building secure APIs container anomaly detection secure configuration management and automated security policy enforcement in a way that highlights (in)security throughout the process for risk identification and “insta remediation ” to coin a phrase The additional benefit of this kind of security rigor is that you can constantly check for compliance against relevant regulations that will govern the implemented app Agile apps development that becomes essentially DevSecOps provides a level of security assurance intrinsic in the automated and orchestrated nature of the process as well as the de facto consistency that automation brings As secure microservices fill out the digital core and secure containers can be leveraged as a service (CaaS) agile composite apps become “cleaner and meaner” in thwarting attacks There is still work to be done in terms of tools business practices and especially culture But if we can build security into agile apps we can ultimately harden the attack surface and finally realize the goal of security being an enabler (no really!) rather than an inhibitor for the business After all at its core cybersecurity is about securing real business value Moving beyond IT transformation Enterprises are moving beyond an application landscape based on service oriented architecture to a second generation characterized by web services microservices and a stronger emphasis on mobility and user experience Also ecosystems are emerging where asymmetrical players establish a niche in the fabric of an industry Meanwhile underlying architectures applications and enabling technologies are quickly evolving As companies move forward with digital transformation the integrated functionality of these applications and services is essential Above all enterprises must view the digital transformation as a business wide transformation not just a transformation of IT Business leaders must not underestimate the amount of logic that lies within their legacy applications That’s one of the reasons companies have great difficulty swapping their entire SAP or Oracle portfolio into something like Salesforce com In the meantime applications are benefiting from a number of maturity constructs that are happening around them such as networks mobility the increasing digitization of communication and the ability to sample internet of things (IoT) data repositories Countless technology trends are enabling enterprises to build and integrate applications in a totally different manner To meet the central challenge of IT to focus on delivering business outcomes organizations must undergo a digital transformation These are the primary steps enterprises should take: Tap into next gen technology The journey to agile applications and digital experiences cannot be undertaken without a clear understanding of what technology is available and what it can do Enterprises need to be positioned to build and deliver scalable applications that are “cloud native” and operate as microservices that can communicate via published APIs Older applications still have value and they need to be accessed using a service approach that is both more cost effective and less risky than wholesale replacement A modern digital application platform typically includes some combination of the following technologies and methodologies: •	Microservices and APIs: A microservices architecture fosters software development as a suite of independently deployable lightweight modular services Each can serve specific business goals by running unique processes and development can be made more efficient by smaller teams working in parallel to deploy services independently These microservices are made accessible by language and technology independent APIs that facilitate consumption across a diverse set of devices and foster a way to measure use This gives companies the ability to determine business value and even drive fee based consumption •	Agile development: Efficiency can be gained by using an agile development approach that employs several iterative and incremental steps This allows for improved collaboration and continuous feedback that helps refine the delivery of a software system •	Internet of things: In the applications world taking advantage of IoT is all about using data that comes from sensors and other connected devices as well as building IoT applications that enhance business operations IoT’s uses are endless For example an airline can build an IoT app that sets off an alert when one of its planes’ engines needs maintenance Other possibilities include connected health smart supply chains and automated metering of utility grids •	Virtualization and containers: These scalable resources make it easier to create loosely coupled components for application composition They are true game changers allowing for rapid movement and scalability of services without overhead costs •	Artificial intelligence (AI): AI and machine learning are opening a new world of possibilities in application development From predictive analytics to chatbots AI is having a strong impact on companies such as allowing data to be utilized in better ways and contributing to more meaningful user experiences As the use of AI grows the core of the applications will become increasingly algorithmic Applications will be built on efficient intelligence constructs eventually becoming structural equation models that can be translated into something humans can more easily understand •	Data services: The availability of data services that are both affordable and functionally fit provides access to petabytes of storage delivered as block object and file storage as well as to both relational and nonrelational databases These data services also often provide options for geographic redundancy Configurations and interfaces designed for massive reading or writing (or both) are typically supported too •	Open source projects: Thousands of well maintained programs supported by global communities of volunteers provide a wealth of application services — and typically at low cost •	X as a service (XaaS): Whether X stands for software platform infrastructure storage or any number of other technologies this pay for use approach to infrastructure and applications offers affordable options that can be metered cataloged and advertised They are services that organizations can use within their own applications integrating to create new services while still paying only for what’s actually used Embrace the digital core In conversations with CTOs and CIOs the concept of the digital core often comes up In short the digital core refers to a reliable agile and scalable foundation for business value streams in the enterprise that provides visibility and insight driven decision making The digital core is fueled by elements such as business networks employees IoT and big data It serves as a central hub of a digital value network that is the primary driver of business transformation For example the digital core can help turn data into insights for making informed business decisions The digital core interconnects all aspects of the value network in real time to drive business outcomes It gives companies the opportunity to bring together business processes with analytics to enable a smarter faster and simpler enterprise This entire value chain including the core is digitized serving as the platform for innovation and business process automation When starting the journey to deploying modern applications it is imperative for enterprises to understand and embrace the digital core Employ an integrated digital service management approach Because digital transformation is about the business it makes sense that business outcomes be used to measure progress Specifically an integrated digital service management (IDSM) approach that incorporates business experience can be used to assess business impact rather than the traditional IT service management (ITSM) approach IDSM approaches the management of systems and services by defining success through measured business outcomes rather than technology related outcomes An IDSM approach requires cultural changes such as selecting tools to facilitate business operational concerns rather than meeting engineering requirements Digitize standardize automate simplify Achieving the digital core requires touching upon each of the four cornerstones of digital transformation: •	Digitize business: Enterprises need to extend business models using IoT big data and analytics and deliver digital business services through mobile and cloud applications Business processes must be adapted to broaden service accessibility and enable digital strategy •	Standardize apps: Application portfolios should be consolidated harmonized and modernized to enable automation and digitization Enterprises need to leverage turnkey industry solutions from the likes of SAP Oracle and Microsoft while maximizing the use of enterprise apps and software as a service •	Automate operations: Operations and business processes should be automated as much as possible using techniques such as industrialization and virtual assistants Algorithmic business operations can be established through machine learning artificial intelligence and cognitive computing •	Simplify platform: The platform environment should be consolidated and simplified to better enable automation and digitization This includes optimizing and standardizing infrastructure and licenses while leveraging prebuilt applications as a service Understand value Delivering business value and improving business outcomes are overriding goals and much of the success of any digital journey depends on getting funded This is where understanding value comes in Simply put if you can’t understand the value of what you’re trying to achieve you are not going to get funded It is crucial for enterprises to be able to understand and clearly define the business value a project will deliver and be cognizant of the eventual business outcomes that will be delivered Digital transformation is driven by business outcomes that are measurable and can be tracked The modern enterprise is not interested in multiyear transformation projects preferring a crawl walk run or prototyping approach For example prototyping approaches provide easy access to use case demos industry specific templates and extensions In short applications need to support value streams Whereas in the past IT has not been considered an innovator today IT needs to be seen as and treated as a value creation center Build the right team Even if an enterprise has all the right technology and processes in place it is no good without the right team Building the right team means having people who understand the importance of creating value and positive business outcomes and also creating compelling digital experiences for employees and customers The thinking of an engineering led IT organization just doesn’t cut it anymore Such a group is not tied into the business and what’s happening outside of IT and its people don’t know how to respond Thus they’re often not helping to make intelligent decisions in IT that organize and align IT to respond to competitive pressures Intelligent Analytics for Smarter Business Decisions Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning force us to rethink the concept of modern applications Take for example the goal of automating company IT operations Just as patterns of engine wear can reveal a lot about driving habits patterns in IT systems data can reveal a lot about the possible sources of friction in a business Patterns of installs and systems access could reveal barriers to technology adoption and even skills gaps Overlaps in the activities recorded for different business systems could reveal silos and redundancy while lags between the activities recorded could mean breakdowns in business communication The DXC Analytics group created agile IT operations applications as part of our Industrial Machine Learning offering Instead of prescribed logic or static business rules these applications have algorithms at their core They integrate real time streams of system logs service call requests and remediation actions But instead of analysing that data using prescribed business logic we built algorithms that predict degraded business operations and that learn and improve over time A big advantage of agile digital applications is their ability to add intelligence everywhere in enterprise business operations In IT operations for example agile applications can help take the friction out of business and deliver a hard to match competitive advantage in the marketplace Companies with a strong analytics IQ are best positioned to benefit When we merge agile and intelligent applications with business process execution we gain the ability to make faster smarter business decisions With a focus on delivering improved business outcomes an effective team should always have two critical people — a finance person and a marketing person After all securing funding and keeping a close eye on costs is essential as is successfully communicating and shaping your project’s messaging If IT leaders don’t get these essential team members on board there’s a good chance they won’t be in their job this time next year Being different delivering value Once a modern applications platform has been successfully implemented the benefits are numerous Agile development and an IDSM approach bring optimized operations improved time to value and increased resiliency Analytics merged with business process execution delivers the insight needed for faster and better decision making leading to improved business outcomes Real time insights from the extended supply chain can be gained with IoT And digital business is enabled in ways that foster innovation with the goal of delivering better richer digital experiences The end state of deploying a modern application can be recognized in many ways For one measurable business results can be achieved through the adoption of adaptive operations which helps enterprises grow by reaching new customers Intelligent assistants can digitize business processes and the increased automation enhances user productivity With all the standardization and automation going on a key for enterprises is to retain the qualities that differentiate them from others This begins by looking at what is differentiating for your business and focusing on building and maintaining applications that provide a competitive edge Finally the end state should be characterized by delivering improved customer engagement and ultimately delivering value to the enterprise The road to improved outcomes The journey to digital transformation in the applications space begins with discovering and understanding where you are and where you need to go Discovery means understanding the estate — analysing and understanding the complex rules and logic that have been built in A new generation of analysers and tools can be used to analyse systems to understand which parts of that system are used which parts are custom built which parts are standard and what components are relevant and mission critical for the company Discovery will lead into a classification of applications and enterprises might find that there aren’t many that truly deliver business value Once the components of a system are defined the system can be thoroughly cleansed much like a spring cleaning A cleaned up system might be a much smaller monster than initially perceived While discovery is a prerequisite for any kind of organization taking into consideration the time and money aspects of a digital transformation is just as important Enterprises should begin their journey by finding slack in both time and money For many organizations that’s a huge limitation They either don’t have the appropriate funding to do something or they don’t have the capabilities for doing it Thus organizations should pick some targets that are going to free up either time or resources This alleviates resources of their existing burden so they can then be focused on something new A couple of different approaches can accomplish this One is to alleviate technical debt by incorporating automation into existing areas that are burdensome and eating a lot of time and resources Another approach is to work in tandem with an outsource provider Digital is changing the world and the digital world is quickly changing Enterprises must change also and adopt a modern digital application platform CTOs and other IT executives must be instrumental in leading this digital transformation Developing agile applications setting forth an IDSM strategy and creating better digital experiences are vital steps in the ongoing digital transformation journey By aligning business and IT you have a strong foundation for digital transformation continuous improvement and delivering improved business outcomes

WITH split(tolower('? Software can be disruptive and enterprises must take steps to deal with the pressures caused by the emergence of nimble upstart companies Software based competition is overturning entire industries and forcing companies to change how they think about their own value The biggest changes will come not from the software applications themselves but instead from the modern application platform and the dynamic integration of the components that power it This includes APIs automation virtualization and microservices Enterprises must also meet the challenge of delivering seamless digital experiences to satisfy rapidly changing consumer driven expectations The central focus needs to be on delivering business outcomes A modern application platform based on business measures rather than technology measures can empower organizations to create new customer friendly services unlock data from older applications and build the foundation of a digital core that will transform the business and deliver measurable results Emerging companies that have formulated an approach that’s based in software and the internet as a way of driving business are causing massive disruptions in the traditional ways of doing things These players can be considered “asymmetrical competition” to established businesses that were once dominant but are now finding themselves having to compete in ways they did not consider before While the asymmetrical competition is unencumbered by technology debt and has no existing capital commitments a significant problem exists for the established organizations They must contend with very large installations of IT that they built at great expense to get to where they are today And above all their IT departments need to find ways to help deliver business outcomes rather than focus on solving technology problems People have become accustomed to smartphones mobile applications and ubiquitous connectivity and are taking these consumer experiences into the workplace demanding a better user experience in their daily interactions If a bank for example does not provide the services and capabilities a customer wants that person will simply switch to a different bank This leaves a group of established players wanting to remain competitive and relevant yet struggling to do things their customers are asking them to do Established enterprises are also burdened by legacy assets that are often technology debt — large investments made on expensive endeavors such as hardware and software for a large data center or a massive ERP implementation Still as companies embrace the cloud these physical assets are disappearing and a stronger emphasis is being placed on the importance of application services and building a modern application platform to provide increased speed flexibility and a stronger alignment with the business IT is clearly challenged by the need to rejuvenate itself to become a business partner and focus on things like value rather than being relegated to a cost line item With the shift to cloud serving as the inflection point the operating model is naturally shifting from infrastructure to everything as a service with a focus on applications and business outcomes Thus enterprises are being challenged to undertake a new generation of digital initiatives that includes the creation of agile applications that provide rich digital experiences Companies must focus on a business wide transformation not just an IT transformation They can do this by deploying modernized enterprise and cloud applications that drive shifts in reach insight and the ability to respond to the increased market pressures that threaten to drive them out of business Disrupting the Industry Disrupting the Adversary If agile apps are a critical component of disrupting the industry then the cybersecurity embedded in those apps is critical to disrupting the adversary For large successful companies digital transformation is really about turning a disadvantage into a disruptor Freeing up business know how (“rules”) and transactional data patterns (“insight”) in agile apps — containing “just in time” analytics — can enable better faster cheaper decision making that is at the heart of competitive advantage Those decisions can then result in adaptive (more effective) operations expansive business models and partnerships and personalized communications for customer intimacy This kind of digital transformation requires risk management with cyberrisk being the greatest risk factor to the business DevOps has led to DevSecOps which has two benefits: building security into the agile DevOps construct and using agile DevOps to build security apps This make sense since orchestration and automation can lead to better built in security for all apps Whereas old school systems development life cycles too often relied on “testing flaws out” of the app rather than “building security in” — from concept to requirements to architecture and through design coding testing configuration and deployment — DevSecOps reduces the opportunity to skip steps or just bolt security on at the end That means inclusion of security tooling constant code scanning building secure APIs container anomaly detection secure configuration management and automated security policy enforcement in a way that highlights (in)security throughout the process for risk identification and “insta remediation ” to coin a phrase The additional benefit of this kind of security rigor is that you can constantly check for compliance against relevant regulations that will govern the implemented app Agile apps development that becomes essentially DevSecOps provides a level of security assurance intrinsic in the automated and orchestrated nature of the process as well as the de facto consistency that automation brings As secure microservices fill out the digital core and secure containers can be leveraged as a service (CaaS) agile composite apps become “cleaner and meaner” in thwarting attacks There is still work to be done in terms of tools business practices and especially culture But if we can build security into agile apps we can ultimately harden the attack surface and finally realize the goal of security being an enabler (no really!) rather than an inhibitor for the business After all at its core cybersecurity is about securing real business value Moving beyond IT transformation Enterprises are moving beyond an application landscape based on service oriented architecture to a second generation characterized by web services microservices and a stronger emphasis on mobility and user experience Also ecosystems are emerging where asymmetrical players establish a niche in the fabric of an industry Meanwhile underlying architectures applications and enabling technologies are quickly evolving As companies move forward with digital transformation the integrated functionality of these applications and services is essential Above all enterprises must view the digital transformation as a business wide transformation not just a transformation of IT Business leaders must not underestimate the amount of logic that lies within their legacy applications That’s one of the reasons companies have great difficulty swapping their entire SAP or Oracle portfolio into something like Salesforce com In the meantime applications are benefiting from a number of maturity constructs that are happening around them such as networks mobility the increasing digitization of communication and the ability to sample internet of things (IoT) data repositories Countless technology trends are enabling enterprises to build and integrate applications in a totally different manner To meet the central challenge of IT to focus on delivering business outcomes organizations must undergo a digital transformation These are the primary steps enterprises should take: Tap into next gen technology The journey to agile applications and digital experiences cannot be undertaken without a clear understanding of what technology is available and what it can do Enterprises need to be positioned to build and deliver scalable applications that are “cloud native” and operate as microservices that can communicate via published APIs Older applications still have value and they need to be accessed using a service approach that is both more cost effective and less risky than wholesale replacement A modern digital application platform typically includes some combination of the following technologies and methodologies: •	Microservices and APIs: A microservices architecture fosters software development as a suite of independently deployable lightweight modular services Each can serve specific business goals by running unique processes and development can be made more efficient by smaller teams working in parallel to deploy services independently These microservices are made accessible by language and technology independent APIs that facilitate consumption across a diverse set of devices and foster a way to measure use This gives companies the ability to determine business value and even drive fee based consumption •	Agile development: Efficiency can be gained by using an agile development approach that employs several iterative and incremental steps This allows for improved collaboration and continuous feedback that helps refine the delivery of a software system •	Internet of things: In the applications world taking advantage of IoT is all about using data that comes from sensors and other connected devices as well as building IoT applications that enhance business operations IoT’s uses are endless For example an airline can build an IoT app that sets off an alert when one of its planes’ engines needs maintenance Other possibilities include connected health smart supply chains and automated metering of utility grids •	Virtualization and containers: These scalable resources make it easier to create loosely coupled components for application composition They are true game changers allowing for rapid movement and scalability of services without overhead costs •	Artificial intelligence (AI): AI and machine learning are opening a new world of possibilities in application development From predictive analytics to chatbots AI is having a strong impact on companies such as allowing data to be utilized in better ways and contributing to more meaningful user experiences As the use of AI grows the core of the applications will become increasingly algorithmic Applications will be built on efficient intelligence constructs eventually becoming structural equation models that can be translated into something humans can more easily understand •	Data services: The availability of data services that are both affordable and functionally fit provides access to petabytes of storage delivered as block object and file storage as well as to both relational and nonrelational databases These data services also often provide options for geographic redundancy Configurations and interfaces designed for massive reading or writing (or both) are typically supported too •	Open source projects: Thousands of well maintained programs supported by global communities of volunteers provide a wealth of application services — and typically at low cost •	X as a service (XaaS): Whether X stands for software platform infrastructure storage or any number of other technologies this pay for use approach to infrastructure and applications offers affordable options that can be metered cataloged and advertised They are services that organizations can use within their own applications integrating to create new services while still paying only for what’s actually used Embrace the digital core In conversations with CTOs and CIOs the concept of the digital core often comes up In short the digital core refers to a reliable agile and scalable foundation for business value streams in the enterprise that provides visibility and insight driven decision making The digital core is fueled by elements such as business networks employees IoT and big data It serves as a central hub of a digital value network that is the primary driver of business transformation For example the digital core can help turn data into insights for making informed business decisions The digital core interconnects all aspects of the value network in real time to drive business outcomes It gives companies the opportunity to bring together business processes with analytics to enable a smarter faster and simpler enterprise This entire value chain including the core is digitized serving as the platform for innovation and business process automation When starting the journey to deploying modern applications it is imperative for enterprises to understand and embrace the digital core Employ an integrated digital service management approach Because digital transformation is about the business it makes sense that business outcomes be used to measure progress Specifically an integrated digital service management (IDSM) approach that incorporates business experience can be used to assess business impact rather than the traditional IT service management (ITSM) approach IDSM approaches the management of systems and services by defining success through measured business outcomes rather than technology related outcomes An IDSM approach requires cultural changes such as selecting tools to facilitate business operational concerns rather than meeting engineering requirements Digitize standardize automate simplify Achieving the digital core requires touching upon each of the four cornerstones of digital transformation: •	Digitize business: Enterprises need to extend business models using IoT big data and analytics and deliver digital business services through mobile and cloud applications Business processes must be adapted to broaden service accessibility and enable digital strategy •	Standardize apps: Application portfolios should be consolidated harmonized and modernized to enable automation and digitization Enterprises need to leverage turnkey industry solutions from the likes of SAP Oracle and Microsoft while maximizing the use of enterprise apps and software as a service •	Automate operations: Operations and business processes should be automated as much as possible using techniques such as industrialization and virtual assistants Algorithmic business operations can be established through machine learning artificial intelligence and cognitive computing •	Simplify platform: The platform environment should be consolidated and simplified to better enable automation and digitization This includes optimizing and standardizing infrastructure and licenses while leveraging prebuilt applications as a service Understand value Delivering business value and improving business outcomes are overriding goals and much of the success of any digital journey depends on getting funded This is where understanding value comes in Simply put if you can’t understand the value of what you’re trying

adapted to broaden service accessibility and enable digital strategy •	Standardize apps: Application portfolios should be consolidated harmonized and modernized to enable automation and digitization Enterprises need to leverage turnkey industry solutions from the likes of SAP Oracle and Microsoft while maximizing the use of enterprise apps and software as a service •	Automate operations: Operations and business processes should be automated as much as possible using techniques such as industrialization and virtual assistants Algorithmic business operations can be established through machine learning artificial intelligence and cognitive computing •	Simplify platform: The platform environment should be consolidated and simplified to better enable automation and digitization This includes optimizing and standardizing infrastructure and licenses while leveraging prebuilt applications as a service Understand value Delivering business value and improving business outcomes are overriding goals and much of the success of any digital journey depends on getting funded This is where understanding value comes in Simply put if you can’t understand the value of what you’re trying to achieve you are not going to get funded It is crucial for enterprises to be able to understand and clearly define the business value a project will deliver and be cognizant of the eventual business outcomes that will be delivered Digital transformation is driven by business outcomes that are measurable and can be tracked The modern enterprise is not interested in multiyear transformation projects preferring a crawl walk run or prototyping approach For example prototyping approaches provide easy access to use case demos industry specific templates and extensions In short applications need to support value streams Whereas in the past IT has not been considered an innovator today IT needs to be seen as and treated as a value creation center Build the right team Even if an enterprise has all the right technology and processes in place it is no good without the right team Building the right team means having people who understand the importance of creating value and positive business outcomes and also creating compelling digital experiences for employees and customers The thinking of an engineering led IT organization just doesn’t cut it anymore Such a group is not tied into the business and what’s happening outside of IT and its people don’t know how to respond Thus they’re often not helping to make intelligent decisions in IT that organize and align IT to respond to competitive pressures Intelligent Analytics for Smarter Business Decisions Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning force us to rethink the concept of modern applications Take for example the goal of automating company IT operations Just as patterns of engine wear can reveal a lot about driving habits patterns in IT systems data can reveal a lot about the possible sources of friction in a business Patterns of installs and systems access could reveal barriers to technology adoption and even skills gaps Overlaps in the activities recorded for different business systems could reveal silos and redundancy while lags between the activities recorded could mean breakdowns in business communication The DXC Analytics group created agile IT operations applications as part of our Industrial Machine Learning offering Instead of prescribed logic or static business rules these applications have algorithms at their core They integrate real time streams of system logs service call requests and remediation actions But instead of analysing that data using prescribed business logic we built algorithms that predict degraded business operations and that learn and improve over time A big advantage of agile digital applications is their ability to add intelligence everywhere in enterprise business operations In IT operations for example agile applications can help take the friction out of business and deliver a hard to match competitive advantage in the marketplace Companies with a strong analytics IQ are best positioned to benefit When we merge agile and intelligent applications with business process execution we gain the ability to make faster smarter business decisions With a focus on delivering improved business outcomes an effective team should always have two critical people — a finance person and a marketing person After all securing funding and keeping a close eye on costs is essential as is successfully communicating and shaping your project’s messaging If IT leaders don’t get these essential team members on board there’s a good chance they won’t be in their job this time next year Being different delivering value Once a modern applications platform has been successfully implemented the benefits are numerous Agile development and an IDSM approach bring optimized operations improved time to value and increased resiliency Analytics merged with business process execution delivers the insight needed for faster and better decision making leading to improved business outcomes Real time insights from the extended supply chain can be gained with IoT And digital business is enabled in ways that foster innovation with the goal of delivering better richer digital experiences The end state of deploying a modern application can be recognized in many ways For one measurable business results can be achieved through the adoption of adaptive operations which helps enterprises grow by reaching new customers Intelligent assistants can digitize business processes and the increased automation enhances user productivity With all the standardization and automation going on a key for enterprises is to retain the qualities that differentiate them from others This begins by looking at what is differentiating for your business and focusing on building and maintaining applications that provide a competitive edge Finally the end state should be characterized by delivering improved customer engagement and ultimately delivering value to the enterprise The road to improved outcomes The journey to digital transformation in the applications space begins with discovering and understanding where you are and where you need to go Discovery means understanding the estate — analysing and understanding the complex rules and logic that have been built in A new generation of analysers and tools can be used to analyse systems to understand which parts of that system are used which parts are custom built which parts are standard and what components are relevant and mission critical for the company Discovery will lead into a classification of applications and enterprises might find that there aren’t many that truly deliver business value Once the components of a system are defined the system can be thoroughly cleansed much like a spring cleaning A cleaned up system might be a much smaller monster than initially perceived While discovery is a prerequisite for any kind of organization taking into consideration the time and money aspects of a digital transformation is just as important Enterprises should begin their journey by finding slack in both time and money For many organizations that’s a huge limitation They either don’t have the appropriate funding to do something or they don’t have the capabilities for doing it Thus organizations should pick some targets that are going to free up either time or resources This alleviates resources of their existing burden so they can then be focused on something new A couple of different approaches can accomplish this One is to alleviate technical debt by incorporating automation into existing areas that are burdensome and eating a lot of time and resources Another approach is to work in tandem with an outsource provider Digital is changing the world and the digital world is quickly changing Enterprises must change also and adopt a modern digital application platform CTOs and other IT executives must be instrumental in leading this digital transformation Developing agile applications setting forth an IDSM strategy and creating better digital experiences are vital steps in the ongoing digital transformation journey By aligning business and IT you have a strong foundation for digital transformation continuous improvement and delivering improved business outcomes

? Traditional IT environments can’t match the pace of change in modern enterprises, and that’s why the hybrid cloud platform is a key element in the digital transformation journey. Combining the capabilities available in the public cloud environment with a modern, on-premises cloud platform eliminates the restrictions of a traditional IT approach, creating a business-relevant infrastructure to meet the demands of business stakeholders, end users and developers. Hybrid cloud environments enable organizations to rapidly develop, deploy, execute and protect next-generation applications through a flexible, policy-driven software-defined platform that reinforces the value IT brings to the business. Enterprises are demanding end-to-end integration within the hybrid cloud environment to manage the complexities of a bimodal IT environment while executing mission- critical business services. An integrated hybrid cloud environment that provides self-service capabilities, elastic resource management, service resiliency, and meets multiple regulatory and compliance requirements is a key enabler for the digital enterprise. IT has a tradition of building silos of technology. Sometimes IT builds silos because the organization has discrete functional requirements. Sometimes it builds them because of budgetary cycles, software licensing, hardware scalability or a convincing sales message. Whatever the cause, organizations often end up with many data repositories and a complex, inflated IT estate. Even as walls go up between applications and data, however, businesses need to tear them down. New channels require new applications. Market windows open and close in a matter of months, even weeks. As a result, application needs have undergone a dramatic shift. Today, the table stakes for new applications include the ability to interface with loosely coupled services, to implement infrastructure as code and to tolerate failures. Application developers, data scientists, business analysts, and infrastructure service providers must work together collaboratively to meet the dynamic needs of the digital enterprise. These requirements fundamentally change the infrastructure that serves them. The limitations of traditional IT environments, once state of the art, are not sufficient to meet the needs of the digital enterprise. Scaling or provisioning infrastructure to meet dynamic demand takes too long, takes too much space, costs too much and limits flexibility. Business leaders pressed to answer urgent needs have been going outside IT to buy services directly, a practice known as “shadow IT.” As cloud architecture has taken root in IT strategy, some businesses have adopted a public cloud-first approach. In certain circumstances, however, a public cloud may not be appropriate or desired for a particular workload, due to regulatory compliance, architecture constraints, software licensing and data sovereignty requirements. A hybrid cloud platform provides a compelling option to address many of these business challenges. A hybrid cloud is a computing resource that automatically manages and monitors the execution of workloads across a combination of computing environments, on- and off- premises, according to the specific needs of the workload. It provides for policy-aligned resources that can be consumed at the point of use. And it employs software-defined APIs using a centralized management, orchestration and governance framework. Successful hybrid cloud platform implementations dramatically reduce lead times, enable the deployment of new features and functions more frequently, reduce failure rates for changes, and improve application resiliency. By 2020, cloud will be where secure and trusted IT services live: Cloud-based encryption, threat analytics, user and entity behaviour analytics, blockchain, and compliance services will proliferate. Enterprises not leveraging the cloud for security services will be viewed as unsecured.

As businesses embrace the cloud, the components in the enterprise shift from being boxes to services provided by clouds. The future enterprise consists of clouds interconnecting with clouds, which are themselves built out of virtual components such as virtual firewalls, specified and spun up in real time in response to a client’s key and mouse clicks. Robotic processes will deploy and update services based upon digital recipes with embedded security controls and monitoring. This will eliminate user error and provide consistent implementation of key services in multiple cloud environments. Services will scale automatically to workload requirements and will recover seamlessly through the built-in resiliency of the cloud platform. Security needs to support this dynamic environment. Cloud providers — whether hybrid services provided by DXC directly, or embraced services from AWS, Azure and SaaS providers such as Salesforce.com — can all provide security add-on services. These services are professional, comprehensive and continually improving. However, they are not enough on their own. T h e t h r e a t .

Standalone solutions inflate IT estate Any business generates and holds a technical debt. Older systems and applications remain necessary to continue operations and are likely to remain in use into the future — even if the replacement budget is not a constraining factor — because of the number of internal and external changes that would be required across all aspects of the business to update them. Many applications have been intricately woven into the fabric of the enterprise, and the cost to reengineer or replace them may outweigh the benefit. This leaves the enterprise with elements of its architecture that cannot be transformed easily. However, the organization can make certain components more efficient without instigating an enterprise-wide change program. Infrastructure provisioning for legacy applications has traditionally been part of a capital outlay and maintenance expense cycle that was repeated every three to five years, with equipment sized to peak requirements, due as much to the procurement and deployment process as to the scale of the workload. This led to oversized and suboptimal workload placement and an unwieldy block of purpose locked infrastructure. The very architecture of software and the way it’s developed is changing radically in ways that dedicated stacks can’t support. Modern software architectures are designed to inherently manage hardware failure through the loose coupling of components, increasing scalability, availability, data protection and disaster recoverability. Business solutions often become a web of smaller services that require multiple data sources inside and outside the enterprise, rather than large monolithic blocks of code designed to maintain availability through intelligent infrastructure that accesses dedicated data sources. Over the next 3 years, 30% of surveyed companies plan to increase their use of public clouds, 28% plan to increase their use of hybrid clouds, and 27% plan to increase their use of private clouds.

Most industries are using intelligent machines to discover something new and do something better than human beings are doing it now. In energy and technology, algorithms are anticipating driver behaviours that could lead to loss and predict the degraded performance of the power infrastructure. Intelligent machines are extending healthcare beyond the walls of the hospital by using environmental factors (such as ozone levels) to predict spikes in emergency room visits. There are even digital worlds that simulate and predict flaws, cost and performance in manufacturing. The power of machine learning grows as more data becomes available. And we are producing new data at an astounding rate. It is entirely possible that within the next 3 years every human being on the planet will create about 1.7 megabytes of new information every second. And we are far from putting this data to good use. By some analyst estimates, we may be capturing only 20 to 30 percent of the value of our manufacturing data, 10 to 20 percent of the value of our public-sector data, and 10 to 20 percent of the value of our healthcare data. In every industry, the barriers to capturing the full value of the data we create are nearly the same. Data is locked away in silos. Getting a machine to spot meaningful insights typically takes a lot of processing power and data storage capacity. The enterprise is yet to be shown a convincing demonstration of These are all challenges that can be met with a strong Analytics IQ and the proper deployment of hybrid cloud technology. The cloud is the fastest and least expensive way to integrate data. The cloud brings sophisticated algorithms, fast computing platforms and massive storage capacity within reach. It lowers the barriers to adoption and makes it easier for enterprises to get their feet wet with inexpensive experiments. Cloud services makes it easier to build compelling applications quickly by delivering in small, meaningful chunks. Intelligent machines are producing data at an astounding rate. Hybrid cloud platforms enable enterprises to capture value from the data to enable their business goals through digital transformation. Figure 1: If you combine the power and flexibility of the cloud with a strong the data’s potential. Analytics IQ, you can add intelligence to just about any part of your business. Application development is shifting to a model of continuous development and delivery, which is built on a model of tight collaboration between IT and the business. That’s a positive step, but it’s a model that runs most effectively on open, dynamically and instantaneously delivered IT stacks. Workloads can then be shifted between private and public infrastructure for policy, flexibility and scale. Addressing the inherent restrictions of traditional platforms through tactical application rewrites and basic cloud enablement can be expensive and may only paint over the cracks. It is ideally targeted at the short-term life extension of an application. Even when appropriate, it can be a complex, lengthy process, and the investment and effort are better expended elsewhere. Technology Platforms: The LEF Perspective The cloud is a platform that is continually unlocking new areas of value for business. With the emergence of machine intelligence, the internet of things (IoT) and 5G networking — collectively what we call the “Matrix” — the amount of data to move, store and process can only be managed effectively on a cloud platform. That’s why the Leading Edge Forum, the independent research and advisory arm of DXC Technology, is adamant that all businesses need to be well on their way to adopting cloud- based technologies, as this is just the first step in a long journey that will enable them to unlock the value the Matrix offers. Just as the cloud itself can be seen as a platform, 21st century organizations are learning how they themselves can become a platform business. They are taking an outside-in approach to their business and technology architecture, embracing ecosystems, becoming important players in external value chains and finding new opportunities to monetize existing assets, while finding new areas where their businesses can play and add value. This all comes with the complexity of having to evolve to new operating models, embrace new technology and create new relationships, all while ensuring that the business is secure and protected, and keeping up with compliance and regulatory issues. Adopting the cloud is hard and requires investment, as does any large organizational shift, but it should not be ignored. The value it is unlocking today is well documented, and we believe the future value it will unlock will make what we’ve already seen look like the tip of the iceberg. Choosing not to embrace it and invest in the change will not only leave you behind in exploring new avenues of value, but we believe will also leave you less able to protect your business. Bad actors are already embracing the cloud to find new and novel ways to exploit your business. Without the power the Matrix offers, you will be hard- pressed to defend yourself when the time comes. More than 85% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to multicloud architectures by 2018, driving up the rate and pace of change in IT organizations. Source: IDC FutureScape: Worldwide IT Industry 2017 Predictions, Doc #US41883016, November 2016 Enabling digital transformation The hybrid cloud platform recognizes and supports the two paces of digital transformation occurring in the industry: the aggressive adoption of social, mobile, analytics and cloud; and the tactical approach to solving distinct client challenges through digital technology. A hybrid cloud platform allows enterprises to embrace full public cloud adoption with confidence and control — and for smaller-scale adoption, it provides accessible entry points into extensible and scalable managed services that can transcend the corporate boundary. CIOs can cater to different groups of users by providing a flexible platform that exposes features compatible with industry-leading providers while allowing older systems to interact safely. Meanwhile, expectations from users have never been higher, fuelled by the ease of access of consumer-grade IT services from cloud providers, along with the pace of enrichment of users’ personal technology mix. These expectations are now justifiably being placed at the CIO’s door, and if IT cannot meet these expectations, the business will reach around internal IT. Transforming to an agile business requires an agile infrastructure, where services are provided, advertised and consumed by developers, information security and operations alike. Expectations from IT for infrastructure as a service (IaaS) have evolved as well. Previously, the point-and-click provisioning of a virtual machine was enough to qualify as a private cloud service. But today’s IT consumers expect coordinated and API-driven provisioning of services across multiple technology domains in any IaaS implementation. They expect blueprinting and recipe deployment through orchestration tools delivering layered application stacks. And they want granularity of abstraction, using container ecosystems and serverless computing. With the mining of vast telemetry sources, microservices are now emerging, which in turn fire an explosion of data into back-end billing and support systems as clients demand a higher resolution view of their consumption habits. Digital transformation of your business is not just about changing your infrastructure or implementing agile management techniques. It is about readying your business for the future, and for some, saving it from the past. Successful transformations recognize and carefully address the interlock among application modernization, integrated digital service management, secure digital networks and a hybrid cloud platform, leading to a business that can innovate freely and operate securely. 2016 Hybrid Integration Opportunity The hybrid integration market will drive growth in public and private cloud markets as customers view hybrid IT as their end state. benefits of the hybrid cloud platform The hybrid cloud platform delivers value to the business by enabling your digital transformation, giving it the best from the public cloud and on-premises infrastructure services, and transcending the corporate boundary — all while keeping you firmly in control. Advances in platform technology are helping organizations make strides toward longstanding goals of agility, simplicity and cost savings. The transformation of platforms from complex and expensive stacks of hardware into flexible computing resources represents a major step toward enabling business agility. Given the ability to provision their own computing resources, through self-service and storefront- like interfaces, business units will be less tempted to turn to shadow IT. The complexity and scope of the IT estate will be greatly reduced. And with consistent control and governance policies applied, the security of the overall system — not just the individual instance — will be improved. In addition, the hybrid cloud platform delivers these business benefits: •	An agile compute infrastructure spanning private and public cloud allows the selection of the right location for workloads. •	Brokerage capabilities provide a relevant set of infrastructure and platform services under a hybrid cloud delivery model, eliminating the challenges of shadow IT. •	Unified and granular visibility into resource consumption shows who, what, where and for how long. This helps address governance, risk and compliance, and leads to better workload analysis, placement and, ultimately, cost optimization. •	Computing resources and platform capabilities can be obtained as a service, which means they can be scaled to fit business needs on demand. •	Harmonized service characteristics across public and private cloud infrastructures provide a consistent experience and deliver the benefits of a managed service with the level of control your business needs. A critical component of the hybrid cloud platform is establishing an on-premises or private cloud to bridge the gap between traditional IT delivery and a public cloud, for workloads that can benefit from a cloud delivery model but need to remain on-premises. The private cloud helps ensure the public cloud is exploited for appropriate workloads while maintaining traditional IT delivery for business-critical legacy applications, which can be optimized in place as needed. Rather than create a “competing” platform, the establishment of a private cloud creates a new center of gravity designed to naturally shift demand from existing infrastructure and shadow IT to a faster, less expensive and more capable alternative. The on-premises or private cloud provides a cloud-like experience, while removing the constraints of traditional service delivery. It has three characteristics that distinguish it from previous virtualized environments: 1.	Infrastructure shifts to flexible converged and hyperconverged platforms and software- defined infrastructure services, replacing specialized, expensive servers and SAN infrastructures. Storage, computing and memory can be provisioned into blocks of computing resources via APIs as needed and can be billed on a usage basis. 2.	Provisioning shifts from manual to automatic. Self-provisioning allows business units to request resources and build environments on demand. Automation and platform services make it possible to support important advances in continuous application development and delivery. DevOps, which relies on tight integration between development and testing resources and the business, relies on the ability to rapidly deploy and maintain applications in different environments. 3.	Workload management shifts from static to dynamic and elastic. A major advance in platform design is the ability to move workloads between clusters of computing resources based on rules or on conditions that are detected when a workload is running. This allows the system to strike just the right balance, providing the amount of computing resources and agility necessary to maintain a specified quality-ofservice level without overcommitting resources during workload changes. Enabling business success The evolution of the hybrid cloud platform represents good news for IT departments that have found themselves perpetually on their heels as they attempt to address an accelerating pace of change with a sprawling, complex and aging IT estate. The hybrid cloud platform represents a significant shift in infrastructure strategy — but it doesn’t have to disrupt current systems, which means this approach can be a positive initial step as part of a digital transformation or can be deployed as a solution to a discrete business requirement. DXC Technology offers industry expertise through consulting and advisory services to help businesses assess current strategy, re-platform current applications or take an entire enterprise on a digital transformation journey. Our approach allows you to start a new project quickly at a disruptive price point. It is extensible, allows self-service, and inherently supports continuous development, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. The hybrid cloud platform is freeing businesses from the constraints of proprietary stacks of hardware and software. It’s creating an environment where business users can get immediate access to the resources they need. It’s eliminating cost through automation. It’s enabling developers to embrace agile delivery. And it’s helping take the “shadow” out of shadow IT. public cloud Enabling the Enterprise Through Hybrid Cloud 2

Standalone solutions inflate IT estate Any business generates and holds a technical debt.

Many applications have been intricately woven into the fabric of the enterprise, and the cost to reengineer or replace them may outweigh the benefit. This leaves the enterprise with elements of its architecture that cannot be transformed easily. However, the organization can make certain components more efficient without instigating an enterprise-wide change program. Infrastructure provisioning for legacy applications has traditionally been part of a capital outlay and maintenance expense cycle that was repeated every three to five years, with equipment sized to peak requirements, due as much to the procurement and deployment process as to the scale of the workload.

Most industries are using intelligent machines to discover something new and do something better than human beings are doing it now. In energy and technology, algorithms are anticipating driver behaviours that could lead to loss and predict the degraded performance of the power infrastructure. Intelligent machines are extending healthcare beyond the walls of the hospital by using environmental factors (such as ozone levels) to predict spikes in emergency room visits. There are even digital worlds that simulate and predict flaws, cost and performance in manufacturing. The power of machine learning grows as more data becomes available. And we are producing new data at an astounding rate. It is entirely possible that within the next 3 years every human being on the planet will create about 1.7 megabytes of new information every second. And we are far from putting this data to good use. By some analyst estimates, we may be capturing only 20 to 30 percent of the value of our manufacturing data, 10 to 20 percent of the value of our public-sector data, and 10 to 20 percent of the value of our healthcare data. In every industry, the barriers to capturing the full value of the data we create are nearly the same. Data is locked away in silos. Getting a machine to spot meaningful insights typically takes a lot of processing power and data storage capacity. The enterprise is yet to be shown a convincing demonstration of These are all challenges that can be met with a strong Analytics IQ and the proper deployment of hybrid cloud technology. The cloud is the fastest and least expensive way to integrate data. The cloud brings sophisticated algorithms, fast computing platforms and massive storage capacity within reach. It lowers the barriers to adoption and makes it easier for enterprises to get their feet wet with inexpensive experiments. Cloud services makes it easier to build compelling applications quickly by delivering in small, meaningful chunks. Intelligent machines are producing data at an astounding rate. Hybrid cloud platforms enable enterprises to capture value from the data to enable their business goals through digital transformation. Figure 1: If you combine the power and flexibility of the cloud with a strong the data’s potential. Analytics IQ, you can add intelligence to just about any part of your business. Application development is shifting to a model of continuous development and delivery, which is built on a model of tight collaboration between IT and the business. That’s a positive step, but it’s a model that runs most effectively on open, dynamically and instantaneously delivered IT stacks. Workloads can then be shifted between private and public infrastructure for policy, flexibility and scale. Addressing the inherent restrictions of traditional platforms through tactical application rewrites and basic cloud enablement can be expensive and may only paint over the cracks. It is ideally targeted at the short-term life extension of an application. Even when appropriate, it can be a complex, lengthy process, and the investment and effort are better expended elsewhere. Technology Platforms: The LEF Perspective The cloud is a platform that is continually unlocking new areas of value for business. With the emergence of machine intelligence, the internet of things (IoT) and 5G networking — collectively what we call the “Matrix” — the amount of data to move, store and process can only be managed effectively on a cloud platform. That’s why the Leading Edge Forum, the independent research and advisory arm of DXC Technology, is adamant that all businesses need to be well on their way to adopting cloud- based technologies, as this is just the first step in a long journey that will enable them to unlock the value the Matrix offers. Just as the cloud itself can be seen as a platform, 21st century organizations are learning how they themselves can become a platform business. They are taking an outside-in approach to their business and technology architecture, embracing ecosystems, becoming important players in external value chains and finding new opportunities to monetize existing assets, while finding new areas where their businesses can play and add value. This all comes with the complexity of having to evolve to new operating models, embrace new technology and create new relationships, all while ensuring that the business is secure and protected, and keeping up with compliance and regulatory issues. Adopting the cloud is hard and requires investment, as does any large organizational shift, but it should not be ignored. The value it is unlocking today is well documented, and we believe the future value it will unlock will make what we’ve already seen look like the tip of the iceberg. Choosing not to embrace it and invest in the change will not only leave you behind in exploring new avenues of value, but we believe will also leave you less able to protect your business. Bad actors are already embracing the cloud to find new and novel ways to exploit your business. Without the power the Matrix offers, you will be hard- pressed to defend yourself when the time comes. More than 85% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to multicloud architectures by 2018, driving up the rate and pace of change in IT organizations.

A hybrid cloud platform allows enterprises to embrace full public cloud adoption with confidence and control — and for smaller-scale adoption, it provides accessible entry points into extensible and scalable managed services that can transcend the corporate boundary. CIOs can cater to different groups of users by providing a flexible platform that exposes features compatible with industry-leading providers while allowing older systems to interact safely. Meanwhile, expectations from users have never been higher, fuelled by the ease of access of consumer-grade IT services from cloud providers, along with the pace of enrichment of users’ personal technology mix. These expectations are now justifiably being placed at the CIO’s door, and if IT cannot meet these expectations, the business will reach around internal IT. Transforming to an agile business requires an agile infrastructure, where services are provided, advertised and consumed by developers, information security and operations alike. Expectations from IT for infrastructure as a service (IaaS) have evolved as well. Previously, the point-and-click provisioning of a virtual machine was enough to qualify as a private cloud service. But today’s IT consumers expect coordinated and API-driven provisioning of services across multiple technology domains in any IaaS implementation. They expect blueprinting and recipe deployment through orchestration tools delivering layered application stacks. And they want granularity of abstraction, using container ecosystems and serverless computing. With the mining of vast telemetry sources, microservices are now emerging, which in turn fire an explosion of data into back-end billing and support systems as clients demand a higher resolution view of their consumption habits. Digital transformation of your business is not just about changing your infrastructure or implementing agile management techniques. It is about readying your business for the future, and for some, saving it from the past. Successful transformations recognize and carefully address the interlock among application modernization, integrated digital service management, secure digital networks and a hybrid cloud platform, leading to a business that can innovate freely and operate securely. 2016 Hybrid Integration Opportunity The hybrid integration market will drive growth in public and private cloud markets as customers view hybrid IT as their end state. benefits of the hybrid cloud platform The hybrid cloud platform delivers value to the business by enabling your digital transformation, giving it the best from the public cloud and on-premises infrastructure services, and transcending the corporate boundary — all while keeping you firmly in control. Advances in platform technology are helping organizations make strides toward longstanding goals of agility, simplicity and cost savings. The transformation of platforms from complex and expensive stacks of hardware into flexible computing resources represents a major step toward enabling business agility. Given the ability to provision their own computing resources, through self-service and storefront- like interfaces, business units will be less tempted to turn to shadow IT. The complexity and scope of the IT estate will be greatly reduced. And with consistent control and governance policies applied, the security of the overall system — not just the individual instance — will be improved. In addition, the hybrid cloud platform delivers these business benefits: •	An agile compute infrastructure spanning private and public cloud allows the selection of the right location for workloads. •	Brokerage capabilities provide a relevant set of infrastructure and platform services under a hybrid cloud delivery model, eliminating the challenges of shadow IT. •	Unified and granular visibility into resource consumption shows who, what, where and for how long. This helps address governance, risk and compliance, and leads to better workload analysis, placement and, ultimately, cost optimization. •	Computing resources and platform capabilities can be obtained as a service, which means they can be scaled to fit business needs on demand. •	Harmonized service characteristics across public and private cloud infrastructures provide a consistent experience and deliver the benefits of a managed service with the level of control your business needs. A critical component of the hybrid cloud platform is establishing an on-premises or private cloud to bridge the gap between traditional IT delivery and a public cloud, for workloads that can benefit from a cloud delivery model but need to remain on-premises. The private cloud helps ensure the public cloud is exploited for appropriate workloads while maintaining traditional IT delivery for business-critical legacy applications, which can be optimized in place as needed. Rather than create a “competing” platform, the establishment of a private cloud creates a new center of gravity designed to naturally shift demand from existing infrastructure and shadow IT to a faster, less expensive and more capable alternative. The on-premises or private cloud provides a cloud-like experience, while removing the constraints of traditional service delivery. It has three characteristics that distinguish it from previous virtualized environments: 1.	Infrastructure shifts to flexible converged and hyperconverged platforms and software- defined infrastructure services, replacing specialized, expensive servers and SAN infrastructures. Storage, computing and memory can be provisioned into blocks of computing resources via APIs as needed and can be billed on a usage basis. 2.	Provisioning shifts from manual to automatic. Self-provisioning allows business units to request resources and build environments on demand. Automation and platform services make it possible to support important advances in continuous application development and delivery. DevOps, which relies on tight integration between development and testing resources and the business, relies on the ability to rapidly deploy and maintain applications in different environments. 3.	Workload management shifts from static to dynamic and elastic. A major advance in platform design is the ability to move workloads between clusters of computing resources based on rules or on conditions that are detected when a workload is running. This allows the system to strike just the right balance, providing the amount of computing resources and agility necessary to maintain a specified quality-ofservice level without overcommitting resources during workload changes. Enabling business success The evolution of the hybrid cloud platform represents good news for IT departments that have found themselves perpetually on their heels as they attempt to address an accelerating pace of change with a sprawling, complex and aging IT estate. The hybrid cloud platform represents a significant shift in infrastructure strategy — but it doesn’t have to disrupt current systems, which means this approach can be a positive initial step as part of a digital transformation or can be deployed as a solution to a discrete business requirement. DXC Technology offers industry expertise through consulting and advisory services to help businesses assess current strategy, re-platform current applications or take an entire enterprise on a digital transformation journey. Our approach allows you to start a new project quickly at a disruptive price point. It is extensible, allows self-service, and inherently supports continuous development, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. The hybrid cloud platform is freeing businesses from the constraints of proprietary stacks of hardware and software. It’s creating an environment where business users can get immediate access to the resources they need. It’s eliminating cost through automation. It’s enabling developers to embrace agile delivery. And it’s helping take the “shadow” out of shadow IT. public cloud Enabling the Enterprise Through Hybrid Cloud 2'), ' ') AS words WITH [w in words WHERE NOT w IN ['?','.',',','a','about','above','after','again','against','all','am','an','and','any','are','aren\'t','as','at','be','because','been','before','being','below','between','both','but','by','can\'t','cannot','could','couldn\'t','did','didn\'t','do','does','doesn\'t','doing','don\'t','down','during','each','few','for','from','further','had','hadn\'t','has','hasn\'t','have','haven\'t','having','he','he\'d','he\'ll','he\'s','her','here','here\'s','hers','herself','him','himself','his','how','how\'s','i','i\'d','i\'ll','i\'m','i\'ve','if','in','into','is','isn\'t','it','it\'s','its','itself','let\'s','me','more','most','mustn\'t','my','myself','no','nor','not','of','off','on','once','only','or','other','ought','our','ours','ourselves','out','over','own','same','shan\'t','she','she\'d','she\'ll','she\'s','should','shouldn\'t','so','some','such','than','that','that\'s','the','their','theirs','them','themselves','then','there','there\'s','these','they','they\'d','they\'ll','they\'re','they\'ve','this','those','through','to','too','under','until','up','very','was','wasn\'t','we','we\'d','we\'ll','we\'re','we\'ve','were','weren\'t','what','what\'s','when','when\'s','where','where\'s','which','while','who','who\'s','whom','why','why\'s','with','won\'t','would','wouldn\'t','you','you\'d','you\'ll','you\'re','you\'ve','your','yours','yourself','yourselves']] AS text UNWIND range (0,size(text)-2)as i MERGE (w1:Word {name: text[i]}) ON CREATE SET w1.count = 1 ON MATCH SET w1.count = w1.count +1  MERGE (w2:Word {name: text[i+1]}) ON CREATE SET w2.count = 1 ON MATCH SET w2.count = w2.count +1 MERGE (w1)-[r:NEXT]->(w2) ON CREATE SET r.count = 1 ON MATCH SET r.count = r.count+1 WITH w1,w2 Match (p:transcript) WHERE p.name='MLP.Cloud' MERGE (p)-[r1:INCLUDED]->(w1) ON CREATE SET r1.count = 1 ON MATCH SET r1.count = r1.count+1 MERGE (p)-[r2:INCLUDED]->(w2) 	ON CREATE SET r2.count = 1 ON MATCH SET r2.count = r2.count+1;

WITH split(tolower('? Traditional IT environments can’t match the pace of change in modern enterprises, and that’s why the hybrid cloud platform is a key element in the digital transformation journey. Combining the capabilities available in the public cloud environment with a modern, on-premises cloud platform eliminates the restrictions of a traditional IT approach, creating a business-relevant infrastructure to meet the demands of business stakeholders, end users and developers. Hybrid cloud environments enable organizations to rapidly develop, deploy, execute and protect next-generation applications through a flexible, policy-driven software-defined platform that reinforces the value IT brings to the business. Enterprises are demanding end-to-end integration within the hybrid cloud environment to manage the complexities of a bimodal IT environment while executing mission- critical business services. An integrated hybrid cloud environment that provides self-service capabilities, elastic resource management, service resiliency, and meets multiple regulatory and compliance requirements is a key enabler for the digital enterprise. IT has a tradition of building silos of technology. Sometimes IT builds silos because the organization has discrete functional requirements. Sometimes it builds them because of budgetary cycles, software licensing, hardware scalability or a convincing sales message. Whatever the cause, organizations often end up with many data repositories and a complex, inflated IT estate. Even as walls go up between applications and data, however, businesses need to tear them down. New channels require new applications. Market windows open and close in a matter of months, even weeks. As a result, application needs have undergone a dramatic shift. Today, the table stakes for new applications include the ability to interface with loosely coupled services, to implement infrastructure as code and to tolerate failures. Application developers, data scientists, business analysts, and infrastructure service providers must work together collaboratively to meet the dynamic needs of the digital enterprise. These requirements fundamentally change the infrastructure that serves them. The limitations of traditional IT environments, once state of the art, are not sufficient to meet the needs of the digital enterprise. Scaling or provisioning infrastructure to meet dynamic demand takes too long, takes too much space, costs too much and limits flexibility. Business leaders pressed to answer urgent needs have been going outside IT to buy services directly, a practice known as “shadow IT.” As cloud architecture has taken root in IT strategy, some businesses have adopted a public cloud-first approach. In certain circumstances, however, a public cloud may not be appropriate or desired for a particular workload, due to regulatory compliance, architecture constraints, software licensing and data sovereignty requirements. A hybrid cloud platform provides a compelling option to address many of these business challenges. A hybrid cloud is a computing resource that automatically manages and monitors the execution of workloads across a combination of computing environments, on- and off- premises, according to the specific needs of the workload. It provides for policy-aligned resources that can be consumed at the point of use. And it employs software-defined APIs using a centralized management, orchestration and governance framework. Successful hybrid cloud platform implementations dramatically reduce lead times, enable the deployment of new features and functions more frequently, reduce failure rates for changes, and improve application resiliency. By 2020, cloud will be where secure and trusted IT services live: Cloud-based encryption, threat analytics, user and entity behaviour analytics, blockchain, and compliance services will proliferate.

Expectations from IT for infrastructure as a service (IaaS) have evolved as well. Previously, the point-and-click provisioning of a virtual machine was enough to qualify as a private cloud service. But today’s IT consumers expect coordinated and API-driven provisioning of services across multiple technology domains in any IaaS implementation. They expect blueprinting and recipe deployment through orchestration tools delivering layered application stacks. And they want granularity of abstraction, using container ecosystems and serverless computing. With the mining of vast telemetry sources, microservices are now emerging, which in turn fire an explosion of data into back-end billing and support systems as clients demand a higher resolution view of their consumption habits. Digital transformation of your business is not just about changing your infrastructure or implementing agile management techniques. It is about readying your business for the future, and for some, saving it from the past. Successful transformations recognize and carefully address the interlock among application modernization, integrated digital service management, secure digital networks and a hybrid cloud platform, leading to a business that can innovate freely and operate securely. 2016 Hybrid Integration Opportunity The hybrid integration market will drive growth in public and private cloud markets as customers view hybrid IT as their end state. benefits of the hybrid cloud platform The hybrid cloud platform delivers value to the business by enabling your digital transformation, giving it the best from the public cloud and on-premises infrastructure services, and transcending the corporate boundary — all while keeping you firmly in control. Advances in platform technology are helping organizations make strides toward longstanding goals of agility, simplicity and cost savings. The transformation of platforms from complex and expensive stacks of hardware into flexible computing resources represents a major step toward enabling business agility. Given the ability to provision their own computing resources, through self-service and storefront- like interfaces, business units will be less tempted to turn to shadow IT. The complexity and scope of the IT estate will be greatly reduced. And with consistent control and governance policies applied, the security of the overall system — not just the individual instance — will be improved. In addition, the hybrid cloud platform delivers these business benefits: •	An agile compute infrastructure spanning private and public cloud allows the selection of the right location for workloads. •	Brokerage capabilities provide a relevant set of infrastructure and platform services under a hybrid cloud delivery model, eliminating the challenges of shadow IT. •	Unified and granular visibility into resource consumption shows who, what, where and for how long. This helps address governance, risk and compliance, and leads to better workload analysis, placement and, ultimately, cost optimization. •	Computing resources and platform capabilities can be obtained as a service, which means they can be scaled to fit business needs on demand. •	Harmonized service characteristics across public and private cloud infrastructures provide a consistent experience and deliver the benefits of a managed service with the level of control your business needs. A critical component of the hybrid cloud platform is establishing an on-premises or private cloud to bridge the gap between traditional IT delivery and a public cloud, for workloads that can benefit from a cloud delivery model but need to remain on-premises. The private cloud helps ensure the public cloud is exploited for appropriate workloads while maintaining traditional IT delivery for business-critical legacy applications, which can be optimized in place as needed. Rather than create a “competing” platform, the establishment of a private cloud creates a new center of gravity designed to naturally shift demand from existing infrastructure and shadow IT to a faster, less expensive and more capable alternative. The on-premises or private cloud provides a cloud-like experience, while removing the constraints of traditional service delivery. It has three characteristics that distinguish it from previous virtualized environments: 1.	Infrastructure shifts to flexible converged and hyperconverged platforms and software- defined infrastructure services, replacing specialized, expensive servers and SAN infrastructures. Storage, computing and memory can be provisioned into blocks of computing resources via APIs as needed and can be billed on a usage basis. 2.	Provisioning shifts from manual to automatic. Self-provisioning allows business units to request resources and build environments on demand. Automation and platform services make it possible to support important advances in continuous application development and delivery. DevOps, which relies on tight integration between development and testing resources and the business, relies on the ability to rapidly deploy and maintain applications in different environments. 3.	Workload management shifts from static to dynamic and elastic. A major advance in platform design is the ability to move workloads between clusters of computing resources based on rules or on conditions that are detected when a workload is running. This allows the system to strike just the right balance, providing the amount of computing resources and agility necessary to maintain a specified quality-ofservice level without overcommitting resources during workload changes. Enabling business success The evolution of the hybrid cloud platform represents good news for IT departments that have found themselves perpetually on their heels as they attempt to address an accelerating pace of change with a sprawling, complex and aging IT estate. The hybrid cloud platform represents a significant shift in infrastructure strategy — but it doesn’t have to disrupt current systems, which means this approach can be a positive initial step as part of a digital transformation or can be deployed as a solution to a discrete business requirement. DXC Technology offers industry expertise through consulting and advisory services to help businesses assess current strategy, re-platform current applications or take an entire enterprise on a digital transformation journey. Our approach allows you to start a new project quickly at a disruptive price point. It is extensible, allows self-service, and inherently supports continuous development, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. The hybrid cloud platform is freeing businesses from the constraints of proprietary stacks of hardware and software. It’s creating an environment where business users can get immediate access to the resources they need. It’s eliminating cost through automation. It’s enabling developers to embrace agile delivery. And it’s helping take the “shadow” out of shadow IT. public cloud Enabling the Enterprise Through Hybrid Cloud 2'), ' ') AS words WITH [w in words WHERE NOT w IN ['?','.',',','a','about','above','after','again','against','all','am','an','and','any','are','aren\'t','as','at','be','because','been','before','being','below','between','both','but','by','can\'t','cannot','could','couldn\'t','did','didn\'t','do','does','doesn\'t','doing','don\'t','down','during','each','few','for','from','further','had','hadn\'t','has','hasn\'t','have','haven\'t','having','he','he\'d','he\'ll','he\'s','her','here','here\'s','hers','herself','him','himself','his','how','how\'s','i','i\'d','i\'ll','i\'m','i\'ve','if','in','into','is','isn\'t','it','it\'s','its','itself','let\'s','me','more','most','mustn\'t','my','myself','no','nor','not','of','off','on','once','only','or','other','ought','our','ours','ourselves','out','over','own','same','shan\'t','she','she\'d','she\'ll','she\'s','should','shouldn\'t','so','some','such','than','that','that\'s','the','their','theirs','them','themselves','then','there','there\'s','these','they','they\'d','they\'ll','they\'re','they\'ve','this','those','through','to','too','under','until','up','very','was','wasn\'t','we','we\'d','we\'ll','we\'re','we\'ve','were','weren\'t','what','what\'s','when','when\'s','where','where\'s','which','while','who','who\'s','whom','why','why\'s','with','won\'t','would','wouldn\'t','you','you\'d','you\'ll','you\'re','you\'ve','your','yours','yourself','yourselves']] AS text UNWIND range (0,size(text)-2)as i MERGE (w1:Word {name: text[i]}) ON CREATE SET w1.count = 1 ON MATCH SET w1.count = w1.count +1  MERGE (w2:Word {name: text[i+1]}) ON CREATE SET w2.count = 1 ON MATCH SET w2.count = w2.count +1 MERGE (w1)-[r:NEXT]->(w2) ON CREATE SET r.count = 1 ON MATCH SET r.count = r.count+1 WITH w1,w2 Match (p:transcript) WHERE p.name='MLP.Cloud' MERGE (p)-[r1:INCLUDED]->(w1) ON CREATE SET r1.count = 1 ON MATCH SET r1.count = r1.count+1 MERGE (p)-[r2:INCLUDED]->(w2) 	ON CREATE SET r2.count = 1 ON MATCH SET r2.count = r2.count+1;

In a connected world disruptions can be devastating A single business in one small corner of the planet can be impacted by geopolitical events and weather disasters thousands of miles away supply chain issues vendor failures and more And as sharing information becomes more prevalent important and complex organizations must work even harder to prevent exposure and respond effectively to cyberrisk With digital transformation information technology has moved to the heart of the enterprise This shift has expanded the need for security continuity and resilience Today’s business must embrace an enterprise risk management strategy that includes legal regulatory and political considerations All levels of the organization should be involved in the discussion Decision makers should include not only the chief risk officer but also the CIO CEO and line of business executives The benefits of protection are well worth the commitment Beyond keeping a business safe strong resilience delivers strategic advantages and greater confidence in the pursuit of new business opportunities Digital transformation changes business models by enabling new types of interactions across the enterprise and with customers partners and suppliers While boosting the business these new connections can profoundly raise a company’s exposure to risk Research has shown that it’s far cheaper to design for security at the start of a technology implementation rather than “bolting on” a solution at the end Yet the need to secure technology up front can create a challenge akin to launching an airplane while it’s still being built There are just too many moving pieces and time constraints Adding to this challenge is the need for organizations — especially large complex multinational ones — to comply with new and ever changing legal and regulatory requirements When combined with a shortage of skilled security personnel the result is a perfect storm of risk And that storm grows bigger by the day Organizations now face a constantly growing range of enterprise risks and cyberthreats While some attacks make headline news others are subtle enough to go undetected for considerable periods of time And many of these incidents do immediate and lasting damage to affected businesses and their reputation in the marketplace An enterprise that fails to protect itself from these security risks may experience the following: • Instant brand damage: A well publicized data loss or major business disruption can lead to brand damage With the rise of social media sites and sharing applications dissatisfied customers can post a video or tweet a complaint making their feelings known to millions of people around the world almost instantly • Data loss and disruption: Cyberbreaches often affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of financial data customer data intellectual property and production and control systems This can result in widespread business and financial risk • Enterprise embarrassment: Malicious actors use “doxing” — the act of collecting and sharing damaging information about a person or organization — to harm an enterprise undermine its goals and embarrass its stakeholders A company that mismanages enterprise risk could face a wide range of negative impacts including a drop in stock price and market cap an increase in operating costs and legal liability and a tarnished reputation Operations could be compromised by a disruption to the supply chain or another adverse event The unfortunate reality is that most organizations will be unable to block every risk and cyberattack This new norm requires them instead to compromise and focus their efforts on detection response and recovery Gaining stakeholder support While many supervisory boards are aware of enterprise risk they often lack a common set of guiding principles Governance should start at the top and involve directors risk committee members and C level executives For example the finance industry uses a three tier model The top 1 “Advancing Cyber Resilience Principles and Tools for Boards ” World Economic Forum 2017 http:// www3 weforum org/docs/IP/2017/Adv_Cyber_ Resilience_Principles Tools pdf level provides independent oversight (including audit and regulatory) the middle level provides the enterprise governance and the bottom level defines how to address risks The World Economic Forum has developed a toolkit for implementing these best practices 1 The organization recommends the following 10 steps which we have expanded beyond cyberthreats to address additional business risks: 1 Create a board: Members will collectively take responsibility for enterprise wide risk oversight 2 Get smart: Board members should have a good command of the resilience subject Get them started with a cyberresilience orientation and keep them informed of new significant threats with regular updates both in the cyberspace and in the physical economic and geopolitical world 3 The buck stops here: Assign one corporate officer the responsibility of reporting on the board’s capabilities and progress And ensure that this officer has the necessary access authority subject matter knowledge experience and resources For True Cyberresilience Take a Structured Approach A structured approach to cyberresilience can help your organization ensure that all operational functions are not only clearly defined but also delivering the levels of protection required by your overall strategy In a clearly defined model risk becomes the cornerstone for cyberresilience ensuring that cyberresilience is embedded in every function This approach provides vital transparency for executives and stakeholders alike DXC Security has developed just such a structured model the DXC Cyber Reference Architecture (CRA) This model is based on work we’ve done to transform and secure some of the world’s largest organizations Our structured CRA describes how to manage risks as well as how to protect detect respond and recover information assets In this model security capabilities are clearly defined DXC Cyber Reference Architecture 4 Get integrated: Risk assessment and resilience should be integrated into the organization’s overall business strategy risk management and budgeting This is best led by the board 5 Annual checkup: Have the board define the organization’s risk tolerance on an annual basis and ensure that it aligns with the corporate strategy (for more on measuring your risk appetite see below) 6 Reporting framework: Make executives responsible for reporting on cyberrisks threats and events during all board meetings Also provide the board with a framework for validating these assessments 7 More planning: Have the board lead the creation testing and implementation of resilience plans 8 Don’t go it alone: Collaborate with other enterprise stakeholders (when appropriate) to ensure systemic resilience 9 Clean sweep: Conduct an annual independent review of your risks as new partners services and information sources come online and as strategies shift 10 Get better: Have the board periodically review its own performance and seek advice for improved effectiveness and digital awareness Determining risk appetite Risk appetite or tolerance can be difficult to measure in part because business units in an organization may view the same risk differently This can lead to inappropriate levels of risk control Fortunately models do exist to help enterprises navigate this terrain The World Economic Forum has established guidelines to help boards define and quantify their organization’s risk tolerance ensuring consistency between its corporate strategy and its risk appetite These include: • Understanding the potential business impact of risk on both individual projects and business lines as well as on the organization as a whole • Agreeing on risk appetite in light of shareholder regulatory customer and external perspectives such as legal and regulatory considerations • Understanding how the balance between meeting business objectives on the one hand and the operational cost and impact of cybersecurity on the other is determined by risk appetite • Clarifying how the agreed upon risk appetite should be applied to business decision making • Presenting the difference between agreed risk appetite and actual risk tolerance on an annual basis In Risky Times Try Antifragility We live in risky times Consider the 2008 financial crisis devastating terrorist attacks the European migration crisis Think about the cyberattacks on corporate national and international infrastructures that have dominated the news And the possibility of trade wars geopolitical conflicts and civil disorder that challenge global stability Today nearly everything is hyperconnected subject to inspection and controllable That’s true for vehicles nuclear power plants factories fridges hospital equipment wearable devices and so much more This connection has brought ease and efficiency to our daily lives but it dramatically increases the risk Making matters worse we often design fragility into our systems and processes particularly in search of efficiency and cutting costs The Leading Edge Forum contends that many businesses and governments have essentially sleepwalked into the 21st century world of VUCA — short for volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity What’s needed instead is an evolution in the way we approach risk — how we think about it sense it manage it and monitor it Unfortunately most traditional approaches to risk management suffer from two major flaws: • They neither fully protect the organization nor help it take intelligent value creating risks in a world of increasing VUCA • Many businesses in their quest for profit growth and efficiency have built engineering fragility into their organizations often accidentally A powerful alternative is the relatively new concept of “antifragility ” an approach ‘Bending Luck’ with Antifragility that not only gains from chaos but requires it in order to survive and flourish The term coined by author Nassim Nicholas Taleb offers several benefits: • A new perspective focused on “bending luck” that guides organizations to win more than they lose when hit by shocks stressors and risks • The fusion of value creation with risk management in high VUCA environments • The ability to be applied at all levels of component process and business models where traditional statistics based correlations still regularly miss unexpected events How the organization views risk matters Instead of taking only an engineer’s view of risk organizations should also consider a financial viewpoint Seen this way risk is an inherent (and not always negative) feature of all business process and value flows Companies can therefore choose activities that offer attractive risk/return profiles or yield curves They can also bend those yield curves in ways that make them even more attractive — Dave Aron global research director Leading Edge Forum Creating a risk framework and matrix The risk framework and matrix are essential tools for discussing and managing risk These guidelines take into account the risk appetite parameters discussed above and align them with actions that must be taken to manage or mitigate threats Within the matrix organizations should outline the complete portfolio of risks they face taking into account all relevant legal operational financial reputational and strategic considerations Identified risks can be assessed across two dimensions: • The potential impact on the confidentiality integrity and availability of assets that may include intellectual property infrastructure and personally identifiable information • The likelihood that threats and vulnerabilities to people processes and technology could put those assets at risk For example retailers may note the risk of customer credit card information being stolen by hackers This act could lead to financial losses unhappy customers and serious reputational damage making it a high impact event And as recent headlines have demonstrated this type of theft is all too common making it highly probable as well Organizations should use the risk framework to highlight possible events their potential effects and response options By separating this discussion from business desires such as the need to simplify transactions and increase customer satisfaction it’s possible to focus on the agreed risk appetite The end state To become resilient both IT and business leaders must engage in ongoing dialogue about the balance of risk versus opportunity Incorporating discussion about cyberrisk and other threats into the overall business strategy is much more effective than simply reacting to the latest “cyberscare ” In fact it normalizes the topic of risk While it may be difficult at first for enterprises to gain a transparent view of threats especially in organizations that have little to no experience in cybersecurity it can be done in part by adopting the structured approach outlined above and by getting all organizational leaders speaking the same risk language To start leaders must identify their current position on the risk versus opportunity continuum; that is where they want to be on the continuum now given the current view of overall strategy and opportunities They may also consider where they want to be in the future as new business opportunities emerge or fail to materialize Will the organization be compelled to take on more risk? Will it be less willing to accept risk? For instance a move to the cloud might expose the organization to new cyberrisks but it can also deliver huge gains such as increased capacity greater flexibility and reduced capital expenses To balance these risks and rewards stakeholders will need to take into account the organization’s overall strategy risk appetite new business opportunities and current challenges Improved resilience can deliver other benefits as well Organizations that gain a better understanding of — and response to — risk can adapt and change more quickly than their competitors Business agility can lead the way to new projects beneficial acquisitions and other fruitful opportunities Ready to manage your enterprise risk in the digital economy? Follow the guidelines outlined above take initial steps to assess your risk status and determine where immediate improvements are needed Then consider partnering with an expert in security management to implement the cutting edge tools that can ensure success Managing Enterprise Risk in a Connected World 2 8

WITH split(tolower('In a connected world disruptions can be devastating A single business in one small corner of the planet can be impacted by geopolitical events and weather disasters thousands of miles away supply chain issues vendor failures and more And as sharing information becomes more prevalent important and complex organizations must work even harder to prevent exposure and respond effectively to cyberrisk With digital transformation information technology has moved to the heart of the enterprise This shift has expanded the need for security continuity and resilience Today’s business must embrace an enterprise risk management strategy that includes legal regulatory and political considerations All levels of the organization should be involved in the discussion Decision makers should include not only the chief risk officer but also the CIO CEO and line of business executives The benefits of protection are well worth the commitment Beyond keeping a business safe strong resilience delivers strategic advantages and greater confidence in the pursuit of new business opportunities Digital transformation changes business models by enabling new types of interactions across the enterprise and with customers partners and suppliers While boosting the business these new connections can profoundly raise a company’s exposure to risk Research has shown that it’s far cheaper to design for security at the start of a technology implementation rather than “bolting on” a solution at the end Yet the need to secure technology up front can create a challenge akin to launching an airplane while it’s still being built There are just too many moving pieces and time constraints Adding to this challenge is the need for organizations — especially large complex multinational ones — to comply with new and ever changing legal and regulatory requirements When combined with a shortage of skilled security personnel the result is a perfect storm of risk And that storm grows bigger by the day Organizations now face a constantly growing range of enterprise risks and cyberthreats While some attacks make headline news others are subtle enough to go undetected for considerable periods of time And many of these incidents do immediate and lasting damage to affected businesses and their reputation in the marketplace An enterprise that fails to protect itself from these security risks may experience the following: • Instant brand damage: A well publicized data loss or major business disruption can lead to brand damage With the rise of social media sites and sharing applications dissatisfied customers can post a video or tweet a complaint making their feelings known to millions of people around the world almost instantly • Data loss and disruption: Cyberbreaches often affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of financial data customer data intellectual property and production and control systems This can result in widespread business and financial risk • Enterprise embarrassment: Malicious actors use “doxing” — the act of collecting and sharing damaging information about a person or organization — to harm an enterprise undermine its goals and embarrass its stakeholders A company that mismanages enterprise risk could face a wide range of negative impacts including a drop in stock price and market cap an increase in operating costs and legal liability and a tarnished reputation Operations could be compromised by a disruption to the supply chain or another adverse event The unfortunate reality is that most organizations will be unable to block every risk and cyberattack This new norm requires them instead to compromise and focus their efforts on detection response and recovery Gaining stakeholder support While many supervisory boards are aware of enterprise risk they often lack a common set of guiding principles Governance should start at the top and involve directors risk committee members and C level executives For example the finance industry uses a three tier model The top 1 “Advancing Cyber Resilience Principles and Tools for Boards ” World Economic Forum 2017 http:// www3 weforum org/docs/IP/2017/Adv_Cyber_ Resilience_Principles Tools pdf level provides independent oversight (including audit and regulatory) the middle level provides the enterprise governance and the bottom level defines how to address risks The World Economic Forum has developed a toolkit for implementing these best practices 1 The organization recommends the following 10 steps which we have expanded beyond cyberthreats to address additional business risks: 1 Create a board: Members will collectively take responsibility for enterprise wide risk oversight 2 Get smart: Board members should have a good command of the resilience subject Get them started with a cyberresilience orientation and keep them informed of new significant threats with regular updates both in the cyberspace and in the physical economic and geopolitical world 3 The buck stops here: Assign one corporate officer the responsibility of reporting on the board’s capabilities and progress And ensure that this officer has the necessary access authority subject matter knowledge experience and resources For True Cyberresilience Take a Structured Approach A structured approach to cyberresilience can help your organization ensure that all operational functions are not only clearly defined but also delivering the levels of protection required by your overall strategy In a clearly defined model risk becomes the cornerstone for cyberresilience ensuring that cyberresilience is embedded in every function This approach provides vital transparency for executives and stakeholders alike DXC Security has developed just such a structured model the DXC Cyber Reference Architecture (CRA) This model is based on work we’ve done to transform and secure some of the world’s largest organizations Our structured CRA describes how to manage risks as well as how to protect detect respond and recover information assets In this model security capabilities are clearly defined DXC Cyber Reference Architecture 4 Get integrated: Risk assessment and resilience should be integrated into the organization’s overall business strategy risk management and budgeting This is best led by the board 5 Annual checkup: Have the board define the organization’s risk tolerance on an annual basis and ensure that it aligns with the corporate strategy (for more on measuring your risk appetite see below) 6 Reporting framework: Make executives responsible for reporting on cyberrisks threats and events during all board meetings Also provide the board with a framework for validating these assessments 7 More planning: Have the board lead the creation testing and implementation of resilience plans 8 Don’t go it alone: Collaborate with other enterprise stakeholders (when appropriate) to ensure systemic resilience 9 Clean sweep: Conduct an annual independent review of your risks as new partners services and information sources come online and as strategies shift 10 Get better: Have the board periodically review its own performance and seek advice for improved effectiveness and digital awareness Determining risk appetite Risk appetite or tolerance can be difficult to measure in part because business units in an organization may view the same risk differently This can lead to inappropriate levels of risk control Fortunately models do exist to help enterprises navigate this terrain The World Economic Forum has established guidelines to help boards define and quantify their organization’s risk tolerance ensuring consistency between its corporate strategy and its risk appetite These include: • Understanding the potential business impact of risk on both individual projects and business lines as well as on the organization as a whole • Agreeing on risk appetite in light of shareholder regulatory customer and external perspectives such as legal and regulatory considerations • Understanding how the balance between meeting business objectives on the one hand and the operational cost and impact of cybersecurity on the other is determined by risk appetite • Clarifying how the agreed upon risk appetite should be applied to business decision making • Presenting the difference between agreed risk appetite and actual risk tolerance on an annual basis In Risky Times Try Antifragility We live in risky times Consider the 2008 financial crisis devastating terrorist attacks the European migration crisis Think about the cyberattacks on corporate national and international infrastructures that have dominated the news And the possibility of trade wars geopolitical conflicts and civil disorder that challenge global stability Today nearly everything is hyperconnected subject to inspection and controllable That’s true for vehicles nuclear power plants factories fridges hospital equipment wearable devices and so much more This connection has brought ease and efficiency to our daily lives but it dramatically increases the risk Making matters worse we often design fragility into our systems and processes particularly in search of efficiency and cutting costs The Leading Edge Forum contends that many businesses and governments have essentially sleepwalked into the 21st century world of VUCA — short for volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity What’s needed instead is an evolution in the way we approach risk — how we think about it sense it manage it and monitor it Unfortunately most traditional approaches to risk management suffer from two major flaws: • They neither fully protect the organization nor help it take intelligent value creating risks in a world of increasing VUCA • Many businesses in their quest for profit growth and efficiency have built engineering fragility into their organizations often accidentally A powerful alternative is the relatively new concept of “antifragility ” an approach ‘Bending Luck’ with Antifragility that not only gains from chaos but requires it in order to survive and flourish The term coined by author Nassim Nicholas Taleb offers several benefits: • A new perspective focused on “bending luck” that guides organizations to win more than they lose when hit by shocks stressors and risks • The fusion of value creation with risk management in high VUCA environments • The ability to be applied at all levels of component process and business models where traditional statistics based correlations still regularly miss unexpected events How the organization views risk matters Instead of taking only an engineer’s view of risk organizations should also consider a financial viewpoint Seen this way risk is an inherent (and not always negative) feature of all business process and value flows Companies can therefore choose activities that offer attractive risk/return profiles or yield curves They can also bend those yield curves in ways that make them even more attractive — Dave Aron global research director Leading Edge Forum Creating a risk framework and matrix The risk framework and matrix are essential tools for discussing and managing risk These guidelines take into account the risk appetite parameters discussed above and align them with actions that must be taken to manage or mitigate threats Within the matrix organizations should outline the complete portfolio of risks they face taking into account all relevant legal operational financial reputational and strategic considerations Identified risks can be assessed across two dimensions: • The potential impact on the confidentiality integrity and availability of assets that may include intellectual property infrastructure and personally identifiable information • The likelihood that threats and vulnerabilities to people processes and technology could put those assets at risk For example retailers may note the risk of customer credit card information being stolen by hackers This act could lead to financial losses unhappy customers and serious reputational damage making it a high impact event And as recent headlines have demonstrated this type of theft is all too common making it highly probable as well Organizations should use the risk framework to highlight possible events their potential effects and response options By separating this discussion from business desires such as the need to simplify transactions and increase customer satisfaction it’s possible to focus on the agreed risk appetite The end state To become resilient both IT and business leaders must engage in ongoing dialogue about the balance of risk versus opportunity Incorporating discussion about cyberrisk and other threats into the overall business strategy is much more effective than simply reacting to the latest “cyberscare ” In fact it normalizes the topic of risk While it may be difficult at first for enterprises to gain a transparent view of threats especially in organizations that have little to no experience in cybersecurity it can be done in part by adopting the structured approach outlined above and by getting all organizational leaders speaking the same risk language To start leaders must identify their current position on the risk versus opportunity continuum; that is where they want to be on the continuum now given the current view of overall strategy and opportunities They may also consider where they want to be in the future as new business opportunities emerge or fail to materialize Will the organization be compelled to take on more risk? Will it be less willing to accept risk? For instance a move to the cloud might expose the organization to new cyberrisks but it can also deliver huge gains such as increased capacity greater flexibility and reduced capital expenses To balance these risks and rewards stakeholders will need to take into account the organization’s overall strategy risk appetite new business opportunities and current challenges Improved resilience can deliver other benefits as well Organizations that gain a better understanding of — and response to — risk can adapt and change more quickly than their competitors Business agility can lead the way to new projects beneficial acquisitions and other fruitful opportunities Ready to manage your enterprise risk in the digital economy?

With digital technologies teams can work efficiently collaborate easily and tap into resources instantly and from anywhere members choose to log on Yet even with these advances workers still want more of a consumerized experience more choice more convenience and more connectivity To meet these demands IT must shift from a mindset of monitoring quality of service to actively monitoring quality of experience predicting potential failures and providing easy to use self service and self healing capabilities Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence embedded devices and real time contextually aware analytics have the potential to drive further enhancements in user experience In this new world users are changing too Regardless of industry or role employees are blending their day to day work with that of an information worker With digital tools users are empowered with greater personal choice and unprecedented opportunities for outside in collaboration Business managers have the ability to differentiate experiences for workers customers and partners And IT organizations can leverage automation and a flexible hybrid cloud infrastructure to make IT both invaluable and invisible to the user IT organizations that can#t navigate this change risk being circumvented by users altogether But those that successfully adopt these tools will evolve into a modern 21st century enterprise one in which work is about more than occupying a desk It#s all about me The growth of globalization and the outside in digital enterprise has thoroughly disrupted the workplace The company/employee equation is changing with the task now becoming the primary focus Collaboration is happening intuitively and digitally across boundaries corporate physical and geographical As workers exercise more independence and pick jobs they#re truly interested in businesses reduce traditional employee benefits and brick and mortar office space to free up resources and gain the flexibility to contract with specialists as needed The result is what#s known as the gig economy Characterized by contract workers doing one (or several) temporary job(s) as opposed to full time work the gig economy is expected to grow to $335 billion in the United States by 2025 according to the Brookings Institution Taking advantage of the trend are new businesses with digital first models Companies such as Appirio and Upwork crowdsource developers and technical freelancers; Eden and TaskRabbit source local workers for everything from installing a printer to packing boxes Even ride sharing firms such as Uber and Lyft are attracting office workers who like the option of earning extra money while commuting to and from work with the added benefit of using the high occupancy vehicle lane on freeways Technology enables this economy offering employees new ways to create connect collaborate and communicate Collaboration is easily becoming second nature as people (and organizations) focus on productivity Freelancers can access the systems they need for each temporary gig Teams can quickly and easily share content tap into resources and synchronize for meetings whether in the office or via Skype with users calling in from anywhere with an internet connection And as the possibilities grow so too do employee expectations In today#s always on always connected world workers expect choice in the devices apps and locations they use to work In fact the workplace has evolved into my place which is wherever I want it to be at the time Systems machines and people begin to interact more seamlessly processes evolve become more data driven and more event driven leading to better alignment with how people want to work In this environment IT organizations could choose to stay the course with traditional policies and approaches but this won#t end well Today#s users won#t think twice about bypassing IT in favour of preferred devices and channels The rise of smartphones and the bring your own device (BYOD) revolution illustrated this and the trend continues today In the IT support space for example users are more likely to Google the answer to a problem or contact a friend than to wait for the company#s help desk to respond This friction between IT and users can result in even greater levels of shadow IT and ultimately information silos and productivity loss Even worse the likelihood of security vulnerabilities increases What#s needed instead is a richer experience one in which IT is everywhere seamlessly enabling the user In the words of futurist Arthur C Clarke Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic Today#s IT organizations need to make magic by aligning technology with experience With this approach workers can focus on the task and become truly hyper productive Done right IT will convert a huge base of true believers rather than working to quell a rabble of rebellious stakeholders New imperatives for the enterprise Users are embracing digital and emerging technologies more readily which could potentially result in a competitive edge But at the same time organizations must ensure security and IT service management To compete effectively enterprises must move away from the one size fits all approach and embrace the user centric service model of it#s all about me to enable a productivity optimized environment The enterprise must address these workplace imperatives: • Foundational capabilities based on IT as a service The new workplace platform is based on a dynamic hybrid infrastructure Services are brokered from cloud providers across software driven infrastructures and networks delivering a high degree of automation while reducing the dependence and latency of human intervention The workplace platform is more than dynamic infrastructure Connectivity and sufficient bandwidth are essential in this impatient now world particularly when collaboration spans traditional corporate boundaries • Services applications and products focused on creating a differentiated consumer like experience The experience must be tailored to the individual rather than forcing all users to accept a one size fits all approach With the right interaction model users can adopt processes and tools themselves Real time data machine learning contextual insights and social analytics can help deliver information in the context of the task at hand In delivering on these imperatives organizations can ensure a higher quality experience for users as well as higher levels of productivity and increased agility in both IT and business services They will realize an environment that is not limited to the physical office but is contextual and augmented enriched and data driven Consider for example the traditional new employee onboarding process For organizations with an enterprise app store the onboarding process can be significantly streamlined New employees can be notified a week before the job starts with an email and instructions about where and when to report how to log on to the email system and what apps to download to access Human Resource systems and travel and expense information Employees arrive ready and able to be productive on day one a rare occurrence in most businesses today Additional business benefits come from the use of analytics which can have a dramatic impact on eliminating waste Consider the Delve feature of Microsoft Office 365 cloud based suite One company applied Delve Analytics to review a weekly 30 minute executive meeting only to discover that preparing for and attending these meetings took employees some 300 000 hours a year at an annual cost of about $45 million Imagine the benefit to the company (and users) if the system had automatically captured actions and made arrangements for the meeting As virtual assistants are developed and integrated into productivity suites this is a feasible real world scenario Performance improvements can also be significant in the new workplace For example a calendar system could over time learn a user#s preferences in preparing for major presentations and automatically schedule meetings contact necessary collaborators and even book flights and hotel accommodations for team members The system could also use preferences to create opportunities that might be unknown to the user For instance it could notice a key client flying into the same city on the same weekend and automatically suggest a meeting place and time and when accepted schedule a meeting that meets both attendees# preferences Benefits to IT By integrating systems in a highly automated manner IT can build user centric processes and composite solutions that in turn deliver agility and repeatability for the business while enabling self service for the user In this way IT organizations benefit from the same user centric philosophy embraced by today#s employees Performance analytics can be embedded in services to proactively monitor for faults substandard performance and dramatic changes in demand Expensive resources such as specialized hardware and software licenses can be dynamically adjusted or removed depending on usage and demand Eventually these services will monitor themselves adapt to usage and threat level changes and heal themselves in the event of a breach Event driven activities such as service management can be optimized and improved with machine learning and mobile applications Aspects such as change control and IMAC (install move add change) can be automated via software driven infrastructure IT can bring real time insight into the business and systems can give fine grained command and control capabilities to spot opportunities for improvement as well as finding anomalies before they impinge on productivity Emerging and enabling technologies In addition to the digital tools entering the workplace now several technologies and trends on the horizon have the potential to further transform the way we work and interact with others Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) is already in use throughout the web and increasingly within the enterprise handling everything from initial call screening for sales prospects to scheduling Chatbots are evolving into more complex virtual assistants interacting with humans to replace phone calls emails and texts Online virtual assistants such as Amy or Andrew at x ai schedule meetings based on calendars and preferences propose a range of times by email negotiate with (human) administrative assistants as needed and send invitations This type of help has a high return on investment: x ai estimates that it takes humans an average of 17 minutes to schedule one meeting while virtual assistants cost less than $100 per month Eventually this will evolve into virtual assistants speaking to each other communicating and negotiating several orders of magnitude faster Suddenly being able to schedule a meeting with eight senior executives in three different time zones all without interacting with a human being will be easy and completely invisible to the human user Contextual insight Sensors embedded devices and wearables are steadily becoming ubiquitous in the enterprise generating huge amounts of data that if not managed well can easily become noise What#s needed is a way to harness data in context to understand relevant factors including location activities environment and even the emotional state of the user The aggregation of information with context is extremely powerful allowing organizations to move toward context or data driven workflows rather than rigid processes Information can be consolidated and tailored to the user#s setting and device with the right information being presented in the right way based on the context at hand The Friction Free Workplace In building a productive workforce the ultimate goal is to give workers tasks that harness their passion and talent But when it comes to achieving this ideal enterprises tend to fall somewhere along a sliding scale and most workers still have to perform tasks they don#t enjoy Take for example the task of resolving an IT issue Often the last thing a worker wants to do is reach out to enterprise help desk services Most of us would rather solve the problem on our own and augment the task with intelligence gained from web searches The most productive option is to fix the problem before it occurs and eliminate the task entirely Data generated from enterprise IT is more than a record of IT systems transactions; it is an early warning system for infrastructure problems By integrating real time streams of system logs service call requests and remediation actions we built and deployed machine learning algorithms capable of predicting degraded IT systems# performance Our analytics sorted the results by actionable factors such as system type region and resolution effort Administrators were alerted about likely problems and issues were Figure 1 is an example of real time monitoring predicting and reporting of degraded IT systems performance Orchestration APIs and the citizen developer Architects and developers have been talking about APIs and orchestration for decades Now it#s a crucial step to boosting business agility and enabling citizen developers If information and resources are exposed as a service across the organization anybody can write enrich and encode algorithms creating new intellectual property for reuse These citizen developers can make and manipulate what they need to enable agile processes systems and composite solutions that can be created in a moment for as long as needed As employees quickly adopt new technologies and collaborate globally they#re an unconstrained force of change Workers will always look for tools processes and approaches to improve efficiency and productivity By empowering the user IT takes the leash off this powerful resource for the good of the enterprise Augmentation Both augmented reality (AR) and augmented information sharing have been available to the enterprise for many years but the entry point is becoming more accessible today Tools such as Microsoft HoloLens are finding a home in manufacturing healthcare education and other fields Similarly AR has boosted capabilities such as user support allowing experts to guide customers through the process of checking repairing or installing an item via a remote view In the future augmentation will be extended to larger groups enabling multiple users to access augmented information with the touch of a finger Groups will be able to simultaneously edit documents on a virtual whiteboard Meetings will include real time summaries of content and next steps so all participants have a common base of understanding Augmentation will become more dramatic with contextual and adjacent information presented in real time and in view of all speakers based on the context of the conversation The interface will continue to be external for now but that could change Instead of holding or wearing a device users may one day become the device Security and identity Security and identity management typically aren#t thought to improve user experience or productivity but a lack of security can bring productivity to a halt especially in today#s connected workplace As we share more information and share it dynamically we need to make sure security protocols are baked into every system and every task This begins with federation and brokerage of identity Since disparate systems are unlikely to be connected in a simple manner organizations must negotiate between users perhaps using virtual assistants to verify identities determine who has access and what can be shared Further security systems should be integrated with machine learning and intelligent systems that can identify and take action when an anomaly is spotted Connectivity and the rise of the ad hoc community With plans already in progress to provide internet service via low latency low Earth orbit satellites 5G and beyond wireless technologies and almost unlimited cloud storage the hyperconnected world is fast approaching In fact many countries already consider internet connectivity a basic right on a par with water and electricity As users we#ve known this to be true for a long time The so called six degrees of separation that connect all living things is getting tighter and we recognize the value of community more than ever Instead of researching a topic we now look for people working in similar fields or facing similar challenges and create an ad hoc community to complete the task These project or task centred engagements fuelled by the gig economy exist in the moment and often in the cloud In this world partners suppliers and customers are the new collaborators Next steps IT and business leaders face the daunting task of not only upgrading workplace technology and modernizing infrastructure but also overcoming user resistance to new ways of working To ensure the workplace transformation delivers expected business benefits organizations must address the people aspects of change (culture behaviour ways of working user resistance etc ) and proactively consider potential lack of consensus among business leaders Organizations cannot simply focus on the technology; in an age of digital automation and robotics people still matter To start the process organizations must consider all enabling and foundational technologies and how they affect the worker experience by asking these questions: • Outside in: Where do they work and is that likely to change? Are they highly mobile? Do they ever work with outside partners? • Personalized choice: What devices do they use now? And what devices might they use in the future? How are they using their devices for work and how could that change? If users bring their own devices who is liable for a breach? What if IT wipes the device due to a breach? Who is responsible for continuity of service? • Global collaboration: Where are the silos in the organization? What impact do geographic and organizational factors have on these silos? Who will need to collaborate in the future and where will they be located? • Social and connected: What are the challenges associated with making connections throughout the organization? Across organizations? How can approaches to collaboration used on social media platforms be applied to the workplace? How will they engage with co workers in the future? How will an organization handle employees with multiple jobs identities and roles? • Contextual insight: How can processes become data driven? How can productivity be increased with real time information in context? Can data be enriched by consolidation and machine learning? What types of data are available and what are the benefits of making it available in real time and in context? • Analytics and machine learning: Could software agents bots or intelligent machines (e g IBM Watson) help make tasks easier?

WITH split(tolower('With digital technologies teams can work efficiently collaborate easily and tap into resources instantly and from anywhere members choose to log on Yet even with these advances workers still want more of a consumerized experience more choice more convenience and more connectivity To meet these demands IT must shift from a mindset of monitoring quality of service to actively monitoring quality of experience predicting potential failures and providing easy to use self service and self healing capabilities Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence embedded devices and real time contextually aware analytics have the potential to drive further enhancements in user experience In this new world users are changing too Regardless of industry or role employees are blending their day to day work with that of an information worker With digital tools users are empowered with greater personal choice and unprecedented opportunities for outside in collaboration Business managers have the ability to differentiate experiences for workers customers and partners And IT organizations can leverage automation and a flexible hybrid cloud infrastructure to make IT both invaluable and invisible to the user IT organizations that can#t navigate this change risk being circumvented by users altogether But those that successfully adopt these tools will evolve into a modern 21st century enterprise one in which work is about more than occupying a desk It#s all about me The growth of globalization and the outside in digital enterprise has thoroughly disrupted the workplace The company/employee equation is changing with the task now becoming the primary focus Collaboration is happening intuitively and digitally across boundaries corporate physical and geographical As workers exercise more independence and pick jobs they#re truly interested in businesses reduce traditional employee benefits and brick and mortar office space to free up resources and gain the flexibility to contract with specialists as needed The result is what#s known as the gig economy Characterized by contract workers doing one (or several) temporary job(s) as opposed to full time work the gig economy is expected to grow to $335 billion in the United States by 2025 according to the Brookings Institution Taking advantage of the trend are new businesses with digital first models Companies such as Appirio and Upwork crowdsource developers and technical freelancers; Eden and TaskRabbit source local workers for everything from installing a printer to packing boxes Even ride sharing firms such as Uber and Lyft are attracting office workers who like the option of earning extra money while commuting to and from work with the added benefit of using the high occupancy vehicle lane on freeways Technology enables this economy offering employees new ways to create connect collaborate and communicate Collaboration is easily becoming second nature as people (and organizations) focus on productivity Freelancers can access the systems they need for each temporary gig Teams can quickly and easily share content tap into resources and synchronize for meetings whether in the office or via Skype with users calling in from anywhere with an internet connection And as the possibilities grow so too do employee expectations In today#s always on always connected world workers expect choice in the devices apps and locations they use to work In fact the workplace has evolved into my place which is wherever I want it to be at the time Systems machines and people begin to interact more seamlessly processes evolve become more data driven and more event driven leading to better alignment with how people want to work In this environment IT organizations could choose to stay the course with traditional policies and approaches but this won#t end well Today#s users won#t think twice about bypassing IT in favour of preferred devices and channels The rise of smartphones and the bring your own device (BYOD) revolution illustrated this and the trend continues today In the IT support space for example users are more likely to Google the answer to a problem or contact a friend than to wait for the company#s help desk to respond This friction between IT and users can result in even greater levels of shadow IT and ultimately information silos and productivity loss Even worse the likelihood of security vulnerabilities increases What#s needed instead is a richer experience one in which IT is everywhere seamlessly enabling the user In the words of futurist Arthur C Clarke Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic Today#s IT organizations need to make magic by aligning technology with experience With this approach workers can focus on the task and become truly hyper productive Done right IT will convert a huge base of true believers rather than working to quell a rabble of rebellious stakeholders New imperatives for the enterprise Users are embracing digital and emerging technologies more readily which could potentially result in a competitive edge But at the same time organizations must ensure security and IT service management To compete effectively enterprises must move away from the one size fits all approach and embrace the user centric service model of it#s all about me to enable a productivity optimized environment The enterprise must address these workplace imperatives: • Foundational capabilities based on IT as a service The new workplace platform is based on a dynamic hybrid infrastructure Services are brokered from cloud providers across software driven infrastructures and networks delivering a high degree of automation while reducing the dependence and latency of human intervention The workplace platform is more than dynamic infrastructure Connectivity and sufficient bandwidth are essential in this impatient now world particularly when collaboration spans traditional corporate boundaries • Services applications and products focused on creating a differentiated consumer like experience The experience must be tailored to the individual rather than forcing all users to accept a one size fits all approach With the right interaction model users can adopt processes and tools themselves Real time data machine learning contextual insights and social analytics can help deliver information in the context of the task at hand In delivering on these imperatives organizations can ensure a higher quality experience for users as well as higher levels of productivity and increased agility in both IT and business services They will realize an environment that is not limited to the physical office but is contextual and augmented enriched and data driven Consider for example the traditional new employee onboarding process For organizations with an enterprise app store the onboarding process can be significantly streamlined New employees can be notified a week before the job starts with an email and instructions about where and when to report how to log on to the email system and what apps to download to access Human Resource systems and travel and expense information Employees arrive ready and able to be productive on day one a rare occurrence in most businesses today Additional business benefits come from the use of analytics which can have a dramatic impact on eliminating waste Consider the Delve feature of Microsoft Office 365 cloud based suite One company applied Delve Analytics to review a weekly 30 minute executive meeting only to discover that preparing for and attending these meetings took employees some 300 000 hours a year at an annual cost of about $45 million Imagine the benefit to the company (and users) if the system had automatically captured actions and made arrangements for the meeting As virtual assistants are developed and integrated into productivity suites this is a feasible real world scenario Performance improvements can also be significant in the new workplace For example a calendar system could over time learn a user#s preferences in preparing for major presentations and automatically schedule meetings contact necessary collaborators and even book flights and hotel accommodations for team members The system could also use preferences to create opportunities that might be unknown to the user For instance it could notice a key client flying into the same city on the same weekend and automatically suggest a meeting place and time and when accepted schedule a meeting that meets both attendees# preferences Benefits to IT By integrating systems in a highly automated manner IT can build user centric processes and composite solutions that in turn deliver agility and repeatability for the business while enabling self service for the user In this way IT organizations benefit from the same user centric philosophy embraced by today#s employees Performance analytics can be embedded in services to proactively monitor for faults substandard performance and dramatic changes in demand Expensive resources such as specialized hardware and software licenses can be dynamically adjusted or removed depending on usage and demand Eventually these services will monitor themselves adapt to usage and threat level changes and heal themselves in the event of a breach Event driven activities such as service management can be optimized and improved with machine learning and mobile applications Aspects such as change control and IMAC (install move add change) can be automated via software driven infrastructure IT can bring real time insight into the business and systems can give fine grained command and control capabilities to spot opportunities for improvement as well as finding anomalies before they impinge on productivity Emerging and enabling technologies In addition to the digital tools entering the workplace now several technologies and trends on the horizon have the potential to further transform the way we work and interact with others Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) is already in use throughout the web and increasingly within the enterprise handling everything from initial call screening for sales prospects to scheduling Chatbots are evolving into more complex virtual assistants interacting with humans to replace phone calls emails and texts Online virtual assistants such as Amy or Andrew at x ai schedule meetings based on calendars and preferences propose a range of times by email negotiate with (human) administrative assistants as needed and send invitations This type of help has a high return on investment: x ai estimates that it takes humans an average of 17 minutes to schedule one meeting while virtual assistants cost less than $100 per month Eventually this will evolve into virtual assistants speaking to each other communicating and negotiating several orders of magnitude faster Suddenly being able to schedule a meeting with eight senior executives in three different time zones all without interacting with a human being will be easy and completely invisible to the human user Contextual insight Sensors embedded devices and wearables are steadily becoming ubiquitous in the enterprise generating huge amounts of data that if not managed well can easily become noise What#s needed is a way to harness data in context to understand relevant factors including location activities environment and even the emotional state of the user The aggregation of information with context is extremely powerful allowing organizations to move toward context or data driven workflows rather than rigid processes Information can be consolidated and tailored to the user#s setting and device with the right information being presented in the right way based on the context at hand The Friction Free Workplace In building a productive workforce the ultimate goal is to give workers tasks that harness their passion and talent But when it comes to achieving this ideal enterprises tend to fall somewhere along a sliding scale and most workers still have to perform tasks they don#t enjoy Take for example the task of resolving an IT issue Often the last thing a worker wants to do is reach out to enterprise help desk services Most of us would rather solve the problem on our own and augment the task with intelligence gained from web searches The most productive option is to fix the problem before it occurs and eliminate the task entirely Data generated from enterprise IT is more than a record of IT systems transactions; it is an early warning system for infrastructure problems By integrating real time streams of system logs service call requests and remediation actions we built and deployed machine learning algorithms capable of predicting degraded IT systems# performance Our analytics sorted the results by actionable factors such as system type region and resolution effort Administrators were alerted about likely problems and issues were Figure 1 is an example of real time monitoring predicting and reporting of degraded IT systems performance Orchestration APIs and the citizen developer Architects and developers have been talking about APIs and orchestration for decades Now it#s a crucial step to boosting business agility and enabling citizen developers If information and resources are exposed as a service across the organization anybody can write enrich and encode algorithms creating new intellectual property for reuse These citizen developers can make and manipulate what they need to enable agile processes systems and composite solutions that can be created in a moment for as long as needed As employees quickly adopt new technologies and collaborate globally they#re an unconstrained force of change Workers will always look for tools processes and approaches to improve efficiency and productivity By empowering the user IT takes the leash off this powerful resource for the good of the enterprise Augmentation Both augmented reality (AR) and augmented information sharing have been available to the enterprise for many years but the entry point is becoming more accessible today Tools such as Microsoft HoloLens are finding a home in manufacturing healthcare education and other fields Similarly AR has boosted capabilities such as user support allowing experts to guide customers through the process of checking repairing or installing an item via a remote view In the future augmentation will be extended to larger groups enabling multiple users to access augmented information with the touch of a finger Groups will be able to simultaneously edit documents on a virtual whiteboard Meetings will include real time summaries of content and next steps so all participants have a common base of understanding Augmentation will become more dramatic with contextual and adjacent information presented in real time and in view of all speakers based on the context of the conversation The interface will continue to be external for now but that could change Instead of holding or wearing a device users may one day become the device Security and identity Security and identity management typically aren#t thought to improve user experience or productivity but a lack of security can bring productivity to a halt especially in today#s connected workplace As we share more information and share it dynamically we need to make sure security protocols are baked into every system and every task This begins with federation and brokerage of identity Since disparate systems are unlikely to be connected in a simple manner organizations must negotiate between users perhaps using virtual assistants to verify identities determine who has access and what can be shared Further security systems should be integrated with machine learning and intelligent systems that can identify and take action when an anomaly is spotted Connectivity and the rise of the ad hoc community With plans already in progress to provide internet service via low latency low Earth orbit satellites 5G and beyond wireless technologies and almost unlimited cloud storage the hyperconnected world is fast approaching In fact many countries already consider internet connectivity a basic right on a par with water and electricity As users we#ve known this to be true for a long time The so called six degrees of separation that connect all living things is getting tighter and we recognize the value of community more than ever Instead of researching a topic we now look for people working in similar fields or facing similar challenges and create an ad hoc community to complete the task These project or task centred engagements fuelled by the gig economy exist in the moment and often in the cloud In this world partners suppliers and customers are the new collaborators Next steps IT and business leaders face the daunting task of not only upgrading workplace technology and modernizing infrastructure but also overcoming user resistance to new ways of working To ensure the workplace transformation delivers expected business benefits organizations must address the people aspects of change (culture behaviour ways of working user resistance etc ) and proactively consider potential lack of consensus among business leaders Organizations cannot simply focus on the technology; in an age of digital automation and robotics people still matter To start the process organizations must consider all enabling and foundational technologies and how they affect the worker experience by asking these questions: • Outside in: Where do they work and is that likely to change? Are they highly mobile? Do they ever work with outside partners? • Personalized choice: What devices do they use now? And what devices might they use in the future? How are they using their devices for work and how could that change? If users bring their own devices who is liable for a breach? What if IT wipes the device due to a breach? Who is responsible for continuity of service? • Global collaboration: Where are the silos in the organization? What impact do geographic and organizational factors have on these silos? Who will need to collaborate in the future and where will they be located? • Social and connected: What are the challenges associated with making connections throughout the organization? Across organizations? How can approaches to collaboration used on social media platforms be applied to the workplace? How will they engage with co workers in the future? How will an organization handle employees with multiple jobs identities and roles? • Contextual insight: How can processes become data driven? How can productivity be increased with real time information in context? Can data be enriched by consolidation and machine learning? What types of data are available and what are the benefits of making it available in real time and in context? • Analytics and machine learning: Could software agents bots or intelligent machines (e g IBM Watson) help make tasks easier? How can user preferences be factored into the process? • Automation: What processes can be improved through automation? Can the infrastructure be transformed to a more agile IT as a service model? How can IT best meet the demands for a dynamically changing landscape of apps and devices? • APIs and service brokering: What IT services are causing the most friction? How do users want to engage with IT today and in the future? Does IT support easy changing of providers?

they affect the worker experience by asking these questions: • Outside in: Where do they work and is that likely to change? Are they highly mobile? Do they ever work with outside partners? • Personalized choice: What devices do they use now? And what devices might they use in the future? How are they using their devices for work and how could that change? If users bring their own devices who is liable for a breach? What if IT wipes the device due to a breach? Who is responsible for continuity of service? • Global collaboration: Where are the silos in the organization? What impact do geographic and organizational factors have on these silos? Who will need to collaborate in the future and where will they be located? • Social and connected: What are the challenges associated with making connections throughout the organization? Across organizations? How can approaches to collaboration used on social media platforms be applied to the workplace? How will they engage with co workers in the future? How will an organization handle employees with multiple jobs identities and roles? • Contextual insight: How can processes become data driven? How can productivity be increased with real time information in context? Can data be enriched by consolidation and machine learning? What types of data are available and what are the benefits of making it available in real time and in context? • Analytics and machine learning: Could software agents bots or intelligent machines (e g IBM Watson) help make tasks easier? How can user preferences be factored into the process? • Automation: What processes can be improved through automation? Can the infrastructure be transformed to a more agile IT as a service model? How can IT best meet the demands for a dynamically changing landscape of apps and devices? • APIs and service brokering: What IT services are causing the most friction? How do users want to engage with IT today and in the future? Does IT support easy changing of providers? Mayan employee create a data driven app? • Security and identity: Does IT have a real time view of the organization#s assets systems and business risks? Is data managed everywhere? How is access control managed when there is no external edge of the network (access might be from anywhere)? Is security a painful experience to users? How are applications and cloud services tested? Are they automated? How will IT handle data sovereignty when users are truly mobile and global? By addressing these questions enterprises can truly change the way employees work and make IT an invisible enabler of change The result will be a better user experience higher levels of productivity increased speed and greater business agility And IT will be assured a central role in the new workplace of me How DXC Delivers the Modern Enterprise DXC Technology is the world#s largest provider of solutions for workplace and mobility With 8 5 million user devices under management and more than 24 000 hands on workplace technicians DXC has the tools and services that help IT departments design implement and run the systems that power the modern enterprise This work includes creating cloud delivery models and native cloud applications modernizing older core applications and enhancing applications with mobility DXC also helps IT departments integrate these applications and bolster them with high level capabilities for cybersecurity identity and access management and governance As new data applications and next generation devices enter your world integration and security are vital So is being able to work the way you choose wherever however whenever That#s why DXC MyWorkStyle is designed as an end to end solution personalized for every way of working It enables a productive and contextual experience DXC#s extensive partner network includes Microsoft VMware Citrix ServiceNow Google Apple Dell EMC HP Inc Hewlett Packard Enterprise and other leaders DXC consultants can help clients understand their business needs and assess user workstyles devices underlying infrastructures and global environments; identify and deploy the right solutions for their businesses; and train their workforces to take full advantage of DXC solutions DXC can help you build the modern enterprise unlock your data and empower your employees partners and customers to get answers to their most important questions With DXC the modern enterprise is here and now Empowering Workforces with Invisible IT 2 7'), ' ') AS words WITH [w in words WHERE NOT w IN ['?','.',',','a','about','above','after','again','against','all','am','an','and','any','are','aren\'t','as','at','be','because','been','before','being','below','between','both','but','by','can\'t','cannot','could','couldn\'t','did','didn\'t','do','does','doesn\'t','doing','don\'t','down','during','each','few','for','from','further','had','hadn\'t','has','hasn\'t','have','haven\'t','having','he','he\'d','he\'ll','he\'s','her','here','here\'s','hers','herself','him','himself','his','how','how\'s','i','i\'d','i\'ll','i\'m','i\'ve','if','in','into','is','isn\'t','it','it\'s','its','itself','let\'s','me','more','most','mustn\'t','my','myself','no','nor','not','of','off','on','once','only','or','other','ought','our','ours','ourselves','out','over','own','same','shan\'t','she','she\'d','she\'ll','she\'s','should','shouldn\'t','so','some','such','than','that','that\'s','the','their','theirs','them','themselves','then','there','there\'s','these','they','they\'d','they\'ll','they\'re','they\'ve','this','those','through','to','too','under','until','up','very','was','wasn\'t','we','we\'d','we\'ll','we\'re','we\'ve','were','weren\'t','what','what\'s','when','when\'s','where','where\'s','which','while','who','who\'s','whom','why','why\'s','with','won\'t','would','wouldn\'t','you','you\'d','you\'ll','you\'re','you\'ve','your','yours','yourself','yourselves']] AS text UNWIND range (0,size(text)-2)as i MERGE (w1:Word {name: text[i]}) ON CREATE SET w1.count = 1 ON MATCH SET w1.count = w1.count +1  MERGE (w2:Word {name: text[i+1]}) ON CREATE SET w2.count = 1 ON MATCH SET w2.count = w2.count +1 MERGE (w1)-[r:NEXT]->(w2) ON CREATE SET r.count = 1 ON MATCH SET r.count = r.count+1 WITH w1,w2 Match (p:transcript) WHERE p.name='MLP.Workplace' MERGE (p)-[r1:INCLUDED]->(w1) ON CREATE SET r1.count = 1 ON MATCH SET r1.count = r1.count+1 MERGE (p)-[r2:INCLUDED]->(w2) 	ON CREATE SET r2.count = 1 ON MATCH SET r2.count = r2.count+1;
